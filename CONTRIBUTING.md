## Code Checkin Process

1. A code change should be proceeded by entering an Issue into github.  
2. Upon approval of the issue (e.g., bug scrub), an assignee can start working on the code change.  
3. Development of new and changed code follows Test Driven Development (TDD).  
4. A set of tests covering the new/changed code must be added.  
5. The spec must be updated accordingly.  
6. A pull request can then be made. Each pull request can cover only one issue.  
7. The comment in the Issue must be updated summarizing what was changed, why and affirming that tests were added and spec updated.
