25308,37111,8.5,"++++ Thematic +++ Bluff - Many randomness   I really like that one. Maybe it's more fun to play as a cylon than as a human, but when you do, you really feel like an undercover agent who awaits the best moment to strike and hurt bad...  It is a long poker time when everyone tries to guess who is who.  Having seen the series is really a must, to enjoy this game, otherwise the thematic won't be appreciated."
54313,12,8,"""well, that ugly artwork certainly helped immerse me in the egyptian theme, cool auction too""  RA!!!"
38165,50,8,"LOVE this game!  If only the GF would play it with me.  Tired at end of day with basic math = bad idea."
56936,1198,5,"SET is a good game, in small doses (in my case very small doses). The game has a simple concept but is a lot more ""thinky"" than it looks. For me the game is fun for 3 or 4 turns, but then becomes too much of a brain burn. In my experience after about 5 minutes I feel like I am having to work rather than having fun. Definitely only a filler game for 5 to 10 minutes for me."
47675,164153,6,"So much better than Descent. Better theme, improved rules, better balance, and better paced with Imperial and Rebel players going on alternate turns.   Update: This is just not a game I really ever want to play. While I definitely see the appeal of the game, I am finding that I am not a fan of these random and combative games. "
94529,31260,8,"Very tense and fun and I love pondering my strategy at the beginning of the game. My rating would be higher if the game wasn't such a bear to set up!"
122420,320,6,"A classic. "
55342,161970,4.5,"rating based on 2 player game."
147851,13,8,"A good game, but sometimes the dice are against me!"
171066,13291,7,"Same rating as base game. New characters are good but doesn't add anything really new for us but keeps the game fresh."
96948,31260,7.5,"Great game but not sure yet how much I like it.  It still feels more like work than fun and the card combos you get can wildly swing the game.  "
70621,12493,9.5,"Great game and very epic with lots of drama and politics.  The different alien races are great as well. "
41393,176189,8,"Knight Level pledge (lots of extra heroes and aboms) "
22801,91536,9,"Looking forward to this one, I hope it'll be good!  9/27 the hype has died down for me since this has came out, I think I'll be passing on this one for right now. I'm sure something better will be out in the future.  Got this for my birthday November 2011. I'm very happy with this game and wish I would have picked it up a long time ago!"
88133,105551,9,"Nice worker placement concept, top material, lots of variety, we mostly play the 2-player short scenario"
110653,483,8,"A classic great game. Easy to learn, difficult to master!"
164768,71721,7,"Very good solitaire play. Looking forward to trying a multi-player game. Surprising amount of depth in such a portable game. Would love to see FFG do a Warhammer Fantasy implementation of this format."
29353,181,4,"This game used to be fun when I played it as a kid but there are so many games that have replaced this one."
65970,1927,2,"REALLY LONG for what it is. This game should take maybe 30 minutes, being that it is at heart a card drawing, dice rolling game with no board and no long-term strategy. Instead, it often takes 90 minutes, and can go as long as 3 HOURS. Unfortunately this is the syndrome of every Steve Jackson game I have played. I will refuse to play this game every time it is suggested, as well as any other SJ games. Maybe they should focus more on gameplay and less on 'humor'- or at least what they try to insist is humor."
172882,29368,8,"A lot of great zombie fighting fun.  B-movie theme works well, goes well with a few friends, beers and nachos. Great package - good work Flying Frog! "
21405,128621,8,"Nice easy Euro"
46212,39856,7,"Better than I expected, but not my favourite type of game."
44168,59946,6.8,"Fun but feels thin; not enough depth in the game system. Severe lack of unique abilities. Punished for everything you do. Nothing good literally ever happens to your characters....it almost feels defeating before you even start. Still a great way to scratch your D&D itch. I don't think this is something I will get on the table often...it's missing that ""fun/excitement factor."" I would play this again though as I enjoy the theme and it plays relatively quickly.  Easy enough to teach casual gamers. Components are top notch, and it looks impressive on the table. It definitely is missing something though; explorations and rewards?  HUGE potential for house rules and variants though. Not my sort of thing normally but I may give it a shot and come up with something interesting."
153331,39463,6,"I know I'm in the minority, but I dislike the forced confrontation in this game."
105806,121921,8.5,"Best co-op I own  Lots of choices, lots of depth combined with a little luck  A fun game that tells a story  Only played scenario 1 (2-player) and look forward to the next scenario  Would consider playing this alone and I don't do that often"
64168,3955,6,"Fun game with a big group."
39803,25613,7,"I enjoy this a great deal, it's a civ game that works on one level-- resource management. It lacks a sort of epic 'feel' I'd expect from a game about the rise of a civilization, there's no 'drama' in it. That having been said, it's good at what it does, and has a decent amount of interaction and some good opportunities for conflict. My other main problem tends to be 'runaway leader' syndrome, it can be impossible to recover if you've taken a beating. Experience may win out over that issue, and I'm certainly willing to play a few more times to see if that's the case."
19827,96848,8.9,"Very cool if somewhat time consuming. Puzzle-like adventuring."
14263,2842,6,"Good game for introducing people to gaming hobby. Plays fast and is not anyhow complex. "
66970,107529,7,"Players are expanding their kingdoms across a hex map of differing terrain.  Simple game where players reveal a terrain card, and must place three of their 40 houses on that terrain - one house (only) per hex.  As houses touch certain hexes, bonus action tiles are earned, allowing extra placements per turn, accelerating the game.  The game ends when someone has placed all their houses, and scores are tallied based on 3 scoring cards randomly dealt from a deck of 10 at the beginning of the game.  Very simple game in terms of mechanics, but has a pleasant ""meaty filler"" feel to it - plays fast, makes you think a little, a little bit of risk and luck involved, but doesn't make you flip the table in anger if it doesn't come off!  The eight map boards and different scoring card combinations keep things interesting and re-playable.  Worth a look."
48697,125618,8,"So simple that even my parents-in-law like it. I love how it makes everyone at the table feel clever when they outguess each other."
186512,181,7,"as long as you understand that this is a dicefest with some diplomacy involved, all is well!"
119849,155703,7,"Better than I thought it would be, honestly.  Kind of fiddly at times (particularly when handing out new species), and the rules really need a FAQ or a few examples, but it is fun, fairly simple to teach, and beautifully illustrated.   Can imagine it would become kind of routine after multiple plays, though, since there seems to be a few trait combinations that are VASTLY overpowered.  Overall, not awful.  "
142703,105134,8.5,"I hate Risk, but this game is impressive!"
36494,147020,7.5,"This is a great first deckbuilder -- the randomized trade row makes it less strategic and more reactive and tactical than Dominion-style deckbuilders, but the short length of the game means that it's not awful if you lose to card draw. Balance between the suits is questionable, but again, for a game this light I'm not sure how much that matters. I have a few of the blister pack expansions."
46288,36218,7,"It is a fun game but honestly I feel like it is over hyped and I would recommend trying a different deck builder"
128947,12333,7,"Wow. So much going on here. Not for the faint of heart."
175345,31627,6,"Not really new for me compared to Ticket to Ride: Europe."
127700,97842,7,"They need to remake this movie - ""Brewster's Billions""."
153306,37111,10,"With expansions  :) Awesome use of theme :) Hidden traitor mechanic is second to none :) Always fun :) Tons of characters to play :) Games always come down to the wire  :!block: - Long :!block: - Needs right group :!block: - Expansions are a mixed bag  :soblue: Hard to teach newbies :soblue: Lots of rules to remember "

189151,15158,6,"Really changes the dynamics of the game.  I will not want to play this every time I play Carcassonne.  "
30983,3076,9,"The one that started it all for me. If this game wasn't so damn good I wouldn't have blown so much money on all these games!"
30955,59959,7.5,"I really enjoy this hidden movement game. It plays very differently from Scotland Yard, which, while fun, can drag a bit. The pre-kill bluffing/planning phases add a nice element to the gameplay, and the multiple night phases allow for some really interesting strategy (spend a couple of nights finding the trail, then extrapolate and start trying to catch Jack). The game rules come with balancing variants that can handicap both Jack and the Police and make it easy to balance for various player strengths."
39413,157354,9,"I'm in love with this game. I can't point my finger on it. The mancala-mechanism is fun. You almost never have a bad turn. This might become a 10, we'll see how much I still love it in a year time."
124622,8217,6,"After Puerto Rico, I was disappointed with this.  Didn't feel like there were either enough roles, or variety in cards, or something.  Still, it's not bad, either.  Setup is a lot easier than Puerto Rico.  I'd play Race for the Galaxy over this every time, though."
106176,201808,8,"a great time. press your luck against your friends in a deck builder."
160279,14996,9,"Simple yet brilliant. Enjoy both the route planning and set collection. Maybe played it a little too much (8 plays listed is probably about a tenth of the real number)"
43878,24508,7.5,"Abstract game with wonderful components. Looks absolutely beautiful when finished."
134158,4390,9," have played ~40 games. The bonus tiles are my favourite part of this game. I feel the graphics aren't as clean as the original, but the scoring is certainly more intuitive. And for some odd reason, I get really excited when I get mushrooms! I think this is the best game of the series."
36654,3076,7,"I see why this game gets such a great rating.  I have been playing it a lot on pr-game.com and also face to face when possible.  The different roles that can be selected.  Competition for limited resources, different paths to victory and rotating turn sequence all make this a fun and challenging game."
43633,39856,6,"good party game, the art is great and I prefer the voting tokens to the pegboards in oddyssey"
18903,2223,5,"So-so game for me, but I keep it around as a warmup to play before I introduce a gateway game."
88969,37111,8,"It's a top game among cooperative bluff games. Especially betrayer will be revealed in the middle of game. Awesome!!!"
119668,2452,6,"Fun with kids, although we discovered it puts dings in cheaper wooden or veneered surfaces."
79642,9209,6,"Great to play with kids or to teach people new to games.  Like TTR Europe a little better"
163681,178900,10,"Nothing to say, sales figure showing everything"
11622,65244,7,"Not bad, a lite version of Pandemic. I'll keep this one for when the kids get older. Is a great travel game."
184333,140620,9,"Really liked the flow of this game - no waiting for players to exhaust their actions. Good level of complexity, easy to learn, and fantastic instructions / card descriptions."
164978,24068,8,"This is one of my family favorites.  The werewolf type game allows for an interesting mix of characters that is always fun to play.  the best part is that point in the game where everyone figures out who each other is.  Then the real chaos begins."
15701,39683,4,"played: 3"
2825,37904,10,"Nice game!"
146086,59946,4,"Played 2x, promptly packed off for trade.  Traded for Roma and Cleopatra and the Society of Architects.  10/26/10"
159742,127398,7.9,"Very puzzly great game. Still have a expansion unplayed. First kill dragon, so hard."
7074,13004,7.5,"Acquired June 08 - Light Gateway game, best 3-4 players.  First play and it was a big hit.  We all had hoots of fun in this light Euro, screaming as we burnt the inhabitants of Pompeii in the lava flows.  Eager to try it with my children as well."
111426,478,6,"Seems better with small numbers of players.  I would rate it lower for large games."
108016,926,5,"when a game last for 3 hours... Way too long should only be played with experienced player of catan"
42121,12,10,"The best auction game around. On top of that, it plays great with only three and is always a short but tight affair. The combination of risk management and constant evaluation of the lot makes this an absolute winner. Oh, and I really like that you're also bidding for what the winner of the previous auction bid."
153509,54998,9,"Some auction, some civilization building, some Risky conquest and a Kraken. Perfect."
130957,39463,9,"Proof that great games stand the test of time.  To mix things up add the expansions.  All of them.  "
103692,6249,8,"This is a really good tile placement game with a gambling-like element (is it worth it to over-spend now for a tile, or should I wait and risk losing it?). I wish it played faster. I don't think the decisions are difficult enough to justify what always ends up being a long play time."
193004,172386,9,"My pick for game of the year 2015.  The action selection mechanic with the multiple discard piles is quite innovative and one of the most clever mechanics I have seen in any game.    This game could be a 10 to me if not for some of the luck related to how the books come out, making that strategy seem too risky.  If it falls into place just right, the book track is extremely powerful - more powerful than any other strategy, but that's the problem, you simply don't know how the books are going to come out, and early investment into books that eventually stalls out can leave you feeling like you'd rather have taken the $$ instead.  Nonetheless, the book track is much more solid than some would lead on based upon a lot of the criticism I have encountered for that particular track.  I think it has some flaws, but it is much better overall than most seem to give it credit for, and you ignore it at your peril if someone else is poised to capitalize on it.  Nonetheless, Mombasa makes its way solidly into my top 10 of all time, and it ranks as my #1 Pfister game (yup, ahead of Great Western Trail, which I think is another great game)."
144863,68448,10,"I really enjoy this game. It comes over first time as a little complex, due to the number of symbols on the cards, but one play through is all it takes to grasp the game.  I like the quick drafting style of card selection that brings in resource collection and construction in a nice easy manner.  I prefer the game on it's own, without expansions, which is why I've never picked any of them up.  I rate this a 10 as I've never not enjoyed it, whether it's been 3, 4, 5, or 6 players. I can't see there being a time I would turn down playing this."
87350,822,6,"Classic game, although I prefer more recent variations on the game (The City, The Discovery)."
98822,70323,8,"After a couple games I was a bit disappointed. It seemed like going to Tokyo made no sense at all since everyone would just beat you. But that was because everyone was rolling for attacks dice, we thought everything else was useless because 20 points seemed so far... But if everyone is aggressive then it's better to just roll for points and avoid attacking at all! But as more people start to roll for points then you're better of in Tokyo because nobody attacks you anyway!  I like how you need to adapt your strategy to the state of the game. There is much more depth than one might think."
129208,163412,8.9,"Awesome game, highly recommended."
96722,25613,7,"Essen 06 Radar.  This is a great game with a really good sense of development.  I played the advanced (but not full) game.  Some card combinations might be overly powerful, but I hope it gets a few teaks before the rumored full production run (finger crossed).  My opinion of the game is higher than my rating would indicate simply because the length would prevent me from wanting to play it too often.  I haven't played Civilization, so Parthenon is actually the closest relative to this game that I have played.  They both have a similar feeling of growth and progression, but while Parthenon is very symmetrical and growth is more limited, the selection of cards makes this much more free form and open ended.  That also means is has the potential to be unbalanced, but that didn't happen in our game."
72680,24480,6,"I enjoy the game and would be glad to play it again.  My wife is getting me the book (900 pages) for Christmas. I will see if this gives me a greater appreciation for the game."
120581,822,8,"Classic tile-placing game which plays great with 2 players and is also suitable for your female company.. When the Inns&Cathedrals and Traders&Builders expansions are added, the game gains the complexity needed to make it exciting!"
151321,43111,9,"Sleeved with Mayday Chimera and Chimera Mini."
133754,43570,8,"Fun, but extremely frustrating.  I have about half a dozen plays and am still nowhere close to beating this, even on easy.  Plus I don't know what I'm doing wrong or how I can improve."
60902,475,9,"This is a fantastic game that is coming off the shelf more often despite a rough first play.  The multiple ways of scoring, the poker-like auction mechanism, and its all around high quality combine for a great, fun game.  Though the leader can really run off if no one can compete in the right cards, and in a five player game there's bound to be someone stuck WAY behind, it's still very fun. Not as crazy about it as 3 or 5 player."
138601,2453,5.94,"Need to try"
47459,173,7,"Very fun, fast-paced and unpredictable game!"
136872,136063,5,"A more chaotic version of Forbidden Island."
6455,475,9,"Knizia does it again. I love the bluffing element in the game. You really have to know when it worth it to keep going or simply just pull out."
109096,34499,8,"It's not an extensive expansion, but its addition of public goals and new cards serve to round out the sets and provide direction.  "
125745,1345,6,"Overall, a very good trading game.  Unfortunately, the theme is the standard trading goods in the Med.  This game screams for an update or at least taking the trading/negotiation part of it and moving it into a more modern theme."
20667,11,7,"Fun little trading game.  Often feels like you have very little control over what is happening, but not being able to re-arrange cards means advance planning is needed.  I often find myself making trades that seem to be balanced in favour of my opponents just to keep from having to blow up my own fields."
74323,69789,5.5,"Found this game rather flat, once you make a decision on strategy at the beginning of the game, you are rather locked into it with no chance at changing strategies"
39716,70323,10,"This is a great quick, easy to learn and fun game. I play with my 5 and 8 yr old boys. I've recommended it to other Dads that have young kids. Excellent game."
25442,169786,9,"Got Hooked at Essen 2015 Backed on Kickstarter"
23641,176396,7.75,"This is my favorite Days of Wonder game. As far as city building, I enjoy Suburbia more, but I find the scoring in Suburbia to be incredibly irritating since you have to do it every time you place a tile, and it interacts with itself, neighboring tiles, other tiles in your suburb, and other tiles in other people's suburb. Basically I like it best at 1 or 2 players. Quadropolis streamlines the entire system. Don't bother with the classic version, jump straight to the Expert version, and boy did it scratch my brain in a good way, without taking 20 minutes to explain. Loved it. Glad it's in my collection."
84963,215,9.5,"Extremely good partnership game, where you place sets like poker hands.  It's not all about getting out first though, there are points in the cards and you need to help your partner too!"
162128,113294,9,"Great 10 min game. Always wanting to play another one ...and another and another!"
54981,2381,6,"x  Good party game."
2462,21523,8,"Perhaps the King of ameritrash. Have not even attempted this with a group as I fear they may react ala AH (see my comments above) Solo this one when I'm in the mood. Does get a little long in the tooth and I find myself getting impatient near the end. Never the less, it's a keeper."
146848,121921,9,"Very good co-operative game (also playable solo, but I never tried it). Encourages planning in advance and is very satisfactory when our previous moves just come together nicely in the later phases. Sometimes you get the feeling you're going to lose the scenario, only for a couple favourable decisions to turn the game on its head to give you the great feeling of accomplishment. Takes some time to prepare though and the game time may exceed 2+ hours."
60780,37111,7,"Pros - The theme fits great with BSG and works. The mechanics make sense with the theme. - Different characters and Cylons add variability - Cool Viper ships - Brings out accusations  Cons - It can get long and a little straight up whenever the Cylons are known - Plays best with 5 or 6 (without sympathizer), and doesn't work with the rest - Longer game to teach - Most people will not be into it as much if they haven't seen the show - Revealed cylons don't have much to do in the base game once revealed - Going through the motions whenever every player is revealed  Sold/Traded because: - Too long for my group - Not enough of my friends have seen the show - Needs 5 or 6 people to play  - The Resistance does it better, is more accessible, shorter, and scales better. "
130960,432,6,"nice little filler game, too much and it gets old quickly"
157814,188,8,"Pick a stone, place it and try to enclose as much territory as you can. That are the rules of Go without entering in special situations or scoring. The rules are terribly simple to teach, but this simplicity hides an incredibly complex and taxing game.  Are you looking for a brain burner? Don't mind if it's an abstract or, even more, you prefer it? Then you must play Go. Magnificent strategy game with an extremely complex structure. Once you have give it a try you might like it or not, but isn't difficult to understand why this one has been alive for so many years.  The problem with this game is the same that chess, shogi and all those classic heavy games: it has been overstudied, so if you don't find opponents of your level one player will consistently trample the other.

121685,129437,5,"I'm not a huge fan of semi-coop games, and it kinda felt that this was watered down Dominion. Still, I'm sure there's an element of skill, and I think I need to play it once more to see if I like it or not."
19252,150376,8,"Need to get ""The Long Night"" sometime soon."
30115,34635,8,"Great game, this game is light enough to attract non-gamers and thought provoking enough to entertain the hard core gamers.  Nice mix of mechanics that keeps one interested throughout the game. Some say this is very similar to Pillars of the Earth, even though it has similar mechanics I don't see the consistent comparisons.  This is like comparing ""Gangster"" (game id: 31621) to ""El Grande"" both area control, but Gangster sucks and El Grande doesn't."
61726,8203,8,"Setting up stinks, but it is a fun lite game that plays 2-4 players.  The version I have also comes in a tiny box and travels well.  It is a good filler game.  Imagine setting up a checkerboard where you have to setup each square.  That is what setting up the game feels like more or less."
89676,39683,7,"Read the instructions several times before my first play. There is some player interaction, but for the most part a majority of the game goes independently from player to player. I think I like it, but I will need to play more games before I can say for sure. It is a game of planning and converting resources."
65755,50,6,"This was a finalist for my choice of a ""coloured cards with numbers"" game (along with Schotten Totten).  But no, it was not to be.  I think, like Schotten Totten, that there are not enough decisions to make here.  Sure, you make some decisions on when to start an expedition, but once the cards are down you're just locked in and waiting to see whether or not you get the cards you need.  Then its just luck of the draw: will you get the cards you need, or will your opponent?  Will you get them at the right time?  I will say that I like that the game forces you to do something every turn; you can't just camp out until you get a perfect hand (like in Ticket to Ride or something).  And I also think the game is actually quite thematic.  For now, Arboretum will be my ""coloured cards with numbers"" game.  It has so many more tough decisions at all stages of the game."
178797,278,6,"I like this game when played with a few house rules to speed it up a bit, 1) replace d6 with two better quality d6 and roll them both and collect both resources 2) stack cards in colors face up 3) yellow cards can be played straight away 4) remove all knight and attack cards 5) change the event die: 2 sides Event, 2 sides windmill: 2 sides year of plenty "
92127,146021,7,"This one seems to take a long time. I've played with six and seven players. Didn't finish the six player game. The seven player game took more than nine hours. Maybe it plays faster with smaller groups? Still a lot of fun, if your friends are up for the commitment!"
56327,48726,6,"Dice chucking and area control in spaaaaace! I totally dig the retro sci-fi vibe. Unfortunately, the game has not aged well. I recommend playing with a max of 3 players, as there is a lot of downtime between turns, and the game runs long. Additionally, the resource stealing aspect of the game can be off-putting to many players."
38862,36218,7,"I traded for a copy. Looked in the box, saw all those endless rows of sorted cards and quietly put it away. Got the rules out a while later, didn't really gel on what the game was about, put it away again.  Finally I discovered an online verion at goko.com, and after watching the bots cream me a few times it finally clicked. What a neat game it is. I had never encountered 'deck building' before, and now that I know what it is, it is very well executed. Of course familiarity with the cards would help tremendously with long term strategies, and I haven't played it enough to know if any of those strategies are pretty much 'givens' or not.  Also, there are a *lot* of cards. *Lots* and *lots* and *lots* of cards. And the endless recycling of the decks, the ever longer chains of action cards...I honestly can't see myself wanting to do it with real cards. :) So I'll be sticking with online play for this one. "

119891,40692,7,"In this reworked version of Vinci, which came out in 1999, players choose a combination of race (e,g, elves, dwarves, amazons, trolls, etc) and ability. One then attempts to take over territories and fight other races, and then one can decide to put their race in decline, and pick a new race.  I think it is better than Vinci. I like how there is a different map for the number of players. The powers and combinations are unbalanced, and a lot depends on if your opponents attack you. That said, it's a fun game, just don't try to take it too seriously."

41170,34635,8,"Received July 2008  Fast paced romp with multiple paths to victory. You can block the hell out of other players options during worker placement.  Includes dice as a randomizer accomplishing the same need as that found in Thebes.  As you do with knowledge when digging in Thebes, you work to increase your chances of success but putting more cavemen in an area and then roll the number of dice equal to the number of committed workers.  Also, collecting and using ""tools"" can alleviate some of the pain of a bad rolls as they allow you to adjust the roll of the dice.  Easy to learn (only three simple steps on each turn).  Took a bit for some of the guys in my group to catch onto the iconography but in general it's pretty consistent and straightforward.  Had to cut slots into the insert to lower the individual player boards which allows the box to close properly.  "
35933,2987,6,"Fun game with lots of good theme. Who doesn't love Pirates? Strategic play suffers from tons of player chaos. Players who don't have to fight other player early in the game can build a huge lead.  July 2007  Update: I find this to be a great gateway game. It's fun and interesting, yet doesn't require a whole lot of thinking. Good game to play with the occasional drop-in non-gamer."

9886,15062,3,"I was really looking forward to this game from the comments and reviews, but when we played it with 7 players it just didn't seem to work very well.  I think it may just have been my expectations going in - I was expecting some sort of RPG-like game where the knights gained better powers and skills as the game progressed.  Instead it seemed fairly helter-skelter in that all the quests were going on at the same time and after we rushed out to win the grail quest the despair cards kept adding catapults (our catapult die rolling was horrid, too - mostly 7s and 8s); we ended up losing after the special black card Morgan caused 4(!) catapults to come out in one turn even though all 9 swords on the table at the time were white.  It's possible I just expected different things and didn't have a strategy going in that made me not enjoy this game as much.  I'd be willing to give it one more shot, but it was definitely not what I was expecting."

53943,9674,6,"Ingenious is a nice fast tile-laying game and I enjoyed it and would play it again.  I didn't like the frequent tile-dumping and found that counting points at each tile-play was a little inelegant.  But for such a quick, clever game with great components, its really minor criticisms.  I don't think I'll buy it though.    "

74206,133038,7,"Pathfinder ACG is a condensed version of the RPG. It excels at capturing the health, items and abilities through a deck builder all within a solo / coop experience. The location decks generally feel unique and thematic.   The constant dice rolling against checks can get a bit monotonous. Also, the difficulty on this version is a bit on the easy side. Many of the challenges and monsters you can just beat your way through.  Last gripe is that it feels like the players are just playing individual solo games and can't (really) interact much on other players' turns.  It's a great attempt at RPG / Card Game hybrid and look forward to playing many of the different versions."

119655,27162,6,"Pretty good but flawed entry-level game. Nice for family play. Designers take note: If you design a game in which higher dice rolls are preferable to lower ones, do not count on the luck to even out, especially over only 15 rolls. The luckiest dice roller should win this game. A few mechanisms attempt to mitigate the effects of luck, but later games do the job better. "

I much prefer the limited environments. My friends and I play with randomly selected PreCon decks (the theme decks from WotC - over 60 different decks to date). This is an excellent way to play.

58545,42,9,"-  An innovative, original design and a classic of early Euro. It is already 10 years old, but it feels as fresh as ever. This is one game whose mechanics don't easily lend themselves to copying. Knizia's best, and deservedly at #2 right behind Puerto Rico. Although, depending on my mood Caylus could occupy the #2 position sometimes.  How about a draw at #2 for both?  This is a good example of why any single list of ""Best of..."" anything can not tell the whole story and can even be misleading.  Back to the game... yes, one of my all-time favorites. With two, it is as engaging as Chess.  There are two reasons I have not given it a 10. The first is the small amount of luck introduced when drawing tiles. The second is the player-induced chaos present in 4-player games (and to a lesser degree in 3-player games). Nonetheless, it is indisputably a masterpiece.   - "

If your group is the kind of people that would bash on the theme they might not like the fact of playing but that doesn't mean they wouldn't enjoy this solid game. It was my first worker placement game I played and I liked the feel of the game. It is easy to learn and every time you play it can bring a different strategy that can be played depending on your Lord,buildings & quests that appeared. While the rulebook & cards can be really thematic the Adventurers components lack it and are just colored cubes. If you like/love this game I recommend investing in some DnDeeples."

The choice of which dice to use is tense, knowing the ones you don’t chose will probably be gone by the time you have another turn.  The cost of using your opponents’ dice is well pitched.  The adequate income means you can survive with few dice.  Alternatively invest in more dice by bringing in new workers, but forgo current actions.  The restriction on expelling existing workers - not more than one of an opponent's from each location, is also pitched well, as is the method with either direct replacement or a queuing system depending on the location.  There are so many other nice and original ideas it was a delight to play.  Probably my favourite and the most original Essen 2010 game, even ahead of Civilisation, 7 Wonders and Key Market.  Looking forward to further plays. Recommended."

The game is brutal and if the cards are against you, you're unlikely to win this one, but that makes perfect sense in such a brutal environment.

In this game each player represents a team manager in the world of Blood Bowl trying to accumulate the most fans.  This is done across 5 rounds where each round a certain number of headlines/tournaments is placed out on the board.  Players play their Blood Bowl player cards on these headlines/tournaments in an attempt to accumulate the most star power and get the rewards for that card.  The depth of the game comes from the abilities on all the different players and upgrades you can get and how best to use them and in what order.  And there is a lot of depth and strategy to this reasonably simple game.  Plus the whole game, even with new players and teaching it to them first, can finish in under an hour.  Even quicker with experienced players.  I've heard complaints about the 2-player variant of this game and honestly I don't think it plays that different at all.  There's less competition and I prefer it with 3 or 4 but it works well for players that mostly play duo also."

Two Player Value = Fair  Three Player Value = Fair   Dungeon Roll is a simple competitive push-your-luck dice game.  One of best things about Dungeon Roll is the speed of the game.  An entire game can be played in under 15 minutes.  That makes this game great for short time frames.  Dungeon Roll is purely a dice game. Dice represent the active player and other dice represent the dungeon he is exploring.  Each turn the player rolls his dice. He then uses those dice to adventure as far into the dungeon as possible. Once a die is used it can not be re-used.  The opposing player acts as the dungeon and rolls dungeon dice each round equal to the current level of the dungeon the player is on. This way the dungeon gets progressively harder the further the player adventures.  Three runs through the dungeon and the game ends. The player that explored the furtherest wins.  A single use activated character ability helps the player each turn.  Dungeon Roll truly is very simple. It uses only a single mechanic and has minimal components. The game is easy to learn and fast to play.  The theme is entirely pasted to the game. This push-your-luck system could be used with almost any theme.   Pros -  - Easy to learn and fast to play   Cons -  - Not much game here.

The auctions in this game can be vicious!   The 2nd half of the game is terrible though, with players just rolling around seeing who lands on each others properties and with the dreaded player elimination. But, again, played by the right rules with a proactive banker and gamerunner, the game only takes about 2 hours. I played a couple of 3-player games recently in less than 90 minutes.

24020,93260,7,"I've only played Summoner Wars about three times. I think it was a decently designed game, but as a card game enthusiast it didn't quite hit the spot with me. I think its the resource system that makes me hesitant to call this a good game, but then again I am a total newbie at the game. I'd say this a decent game, but there are better card games out there."
42271,68448,8.5,"An enjoyable game, It's reasonably complex yet still easy enough to teach new players in a short amount of time. Gameplay is a little dry as you are basically taking a card and passing your hand to the next player. However, there is enough variety in the cards (and wonders), and in what you can do with them, that I don't mind it too much. I love games with good artwork and 7 Wonders has great artwork. Quite honestly this games biggest plus is the short amount of time it takes to play. I tend to like longer, more strategic games, and was pleased to find that 7 Wonders was a short, fast paced game that has a good amount of strategy.  "

126648,18,4,"When I played this game, one of the players had no idea what was going on and could not move at all.  The rest of us were bunched until I made a breakaway.  Once I got ahead, I could move freely and there was no way for the rest of the players to catch up becasue they kept bumping into and shooting eachother.  It was different from any other game I have played, but it was slow moving and the programming mechanic made this feel too much like work.  "

There are a lot of politics at play in this game, as people will try and gain revenge when you snub their card.

177092,140,6,"My game does not have the bell, but I see why this game comes with a bell.  The bell is not a gimmick, it's a tie breaking mechanism.  Players often corner the markets simultaneously, which in my bell-less game results in a tie.  Regardless, a fun fast paced, and FAST trading game.  To be played only when standing up."

Very irritating if playing with an experienced player. They know how to screw you up so bad and it feels like you can't do anything about it. It's fun if you can teach your new player the strategy because the game mechanics are simple enough to pick up fast. Hardest concept is the farmers, which makes the game very tricky."
66970,2651,8,"Excellent business/planning game where players are attempting to run power to an increasing number of cities.  Players link the cities ""crayon rail game"" style (or in the new edition, by simply placing wooden houses in cities on the printed power grid), via drawing on the mapsheet and run the power by picking up power plants at auction.  Money is earned based on cities powered and is used for better plants, the resources to run them, and further power links.  Great game."

21346,132531,6,"I've played 'Race' enough times to know that it's not really a game I want to pursue any further. Confusing iconography, awkward production/trade phases, and a game that rewards experience with bonus card combos means those who have played the game more will always crush those who have played it less while less-experienced players smell defeat about 10 minutes into it. I do like the spirit of Race and the impressive artwork, but that's about it.  I wanted to try Roll because (again) the spirit of Race is pretty awesome and I was hoping for a game that could capture the spirit but does it in a more straightforward way. I had no idea what to expect (or even if this was the goal of the designers).  What I found was a game almost completely devoid of that ""spirit"". It's quite MPS (with some indirect interaction) and not a very interesting solitaire game at that. Dice are generalized enough that you can pretty much do what you want without the dice getting in the way.  The designers clearly wanted to avoid the dice dictating your turn, so they went for a way to limit that feeling at the expense of the tension inherent in the core mechanic itself.  For a dice game I'm surprised by how irrelevant the dice felt by the end. Never did I feel like I had to make a crucial decision between one choice or the other. The game was all: build tiles, get some dice, roll some dice, build some more tiles, rush to the end of the game.  There are so many points in the tiles and it's pretty easy to build them that pursuing a produce/trade strategy seemed like a comparative time-waster to throwing everything into high-scoring tiles.  Even mining for the best tiles seems like a waste of time as my impression is working with that you got the first time around is slightly better than spending several turns hunting for better tiles. Certainly there are things to explore in the game for a group who loves it and yes there are ways to counter a player who is just dumping everything into colonize/research.  But for a first-time player and one who wants to be inspired to play more, 'Roll' comes off as fiddly, cumbersome, and for the most part, uninspired game.  My '6' rating is based on the fact that it is well-worked, unique as dice games go, and thoroughly designed. I try to rate games less on personal enjoyment and more on the craft of the game itself.  Plus, benefit of the doubt has to go to the fact that I have only played it once.  Lehmann and the Rio Grande team are no slouches when it comes to building something to its completion, and 'Roll' never comes off as half-baked or impractical. My guess is relative newcomer designer Huang did the majority of the design here and Lehmann simply lent his core ideas to the game.  This isn't to say that Huang's design comes off as amateurish (it doesn't) but rather that the game feels less aligned with what I feel most inspired ""Race': The theme.  'Roll' literally gets buried under its mechanisms and feels a shade colder because of it.  Though I have never been a true fan of  'Race', I would rather play Race now that I've experienced both.  Honestly, I'd still rather play San Juan."

160591,92415,7,"Bluffing reduced to the max. While Liar's Dice still needed dice to give a base for players' bids, Skull & Roses uses coasters (one each with a skull, three with roses) that players put on their mat. From others' bids and/or minds the players have to guess who bid the good roses and who has bad skulls. Needs the right group of at least 4 or 5 who like to play other players and not only the game to really work but then it's one of the most fun 15 minute fillers around."
165940,146652,9,"I love the mechanic and level of suspense this game manages to deliver.  Very fun.  Initial unboxing is a tedious chore, and it lacks variety after multiple plays, but it's still solid, and mechanically satisfying."

1219,104162,6.5,"New version of this popular dungeon crawler. It's got pretty much everything I like in a game: theme, miniatures, dice, cooperative play; however, for some reason I'm not as enthralled with this as much as I was with the D&D Adventure games, but it's only been two quests, so I'll re-evaluate in a while.  The miniatures are great, the gameplay is very quick, and the components are top notch (it is Fantasy Flight, after all). I look forward to playing more of this and hopefully loving it!!"

142665,24480,5,"This game puts the components above the gameplay: it could be easily streamlined (why not have a track for the workers in the same way that money is handled?) so that there is less to do.

34554,37380,6,"Nice Yahtzee variant with some real choices (but no more difficult). Much, much better than the Catan Dice game (which is extremely restrictive - Yahtzee has more choices).   I believe the game is better if one modifies the rules a bit - the game as it stands is over far too quickly. We often play that the game ends when one player has 7 techs (vrs 5) or when all of the monuments have been built AND one player has at least 3 of these (not necessarily the first place monument but has at least 3). This seems to add just enough time to make the game a bit meatier without overstaying its welcome."
105788,521,7,"Just a lot of fun to play, and it requires quite a bit of skill to boot.  The only downside is that, if you're pretty good, play doesn't REALLY start until someone misses a bullseye, which may take a few shots."

40033,18,5,"RoboRally is a fine game, and it definitely has some really good qualities.  I like the simultaneous move planning, and I like that it can play with a wide range of players.  The upgrade cards are a good touch, though I wish they were easier to get, and the ability to customize maps is always a plus.  But I just don't find myself enjoying this game as much as I think I should.  Perhaps its that your control over movement is on such a fine level that the progress comes really slowly.  Or perhaps it is that despite the fine control, you are really at the whim of the cards and it is actually quite difficult to go where you want to.  I don't have any trouble visualizing how the board will effect me, so it is only the cards that seem to thwart me.  I don't mind playing RoboRally, but I wouldn't pull it out unless there were a lot of players."
8398,169786,8,"Wouldn't have gone near it if it wasn't for Gamenight! and my friend owning the game. Seems as heavy as Terra Mystica, I didn't even check out the game on BGG so I didn't know that Scythe was more of a medium-weight game as compared to TM. Awesome game with different things to do, you can deploy mechs, hire workers, produce resources, combat with others, pay to increase popularity, combat power/cards and resources, you also have to check what your neighbours are doing more than those further away due to ""enlist"" benefits and encounter tokens. The encounter card provided a side entertainment for me. Most probably won't win but still willing to try again if given the chance."
36340,278,2,"Purchased 06/23/06   Good game, lots of interesting choices, but develops SLOWLY....waaaaaaaay too slowly.  After an hour in, I was in the lead with 8/12 VP.  Maybe play to 10?  Way too long for what it is, but perhaps future playings will speed things up a bit."

7422,105551,6,"Intimidating rules at first, but it actually plays really smoothly. Hidden goals at the end makes it seem pretty obtuse, but once everyone is familiar with the game you kind of know what you're going for overall. The map you make during play is just gorgeous- one of the nicest looking boards I've seen. Every archipelago comes out totally differently.  Edit: Bringing down the rating some. It's an excellent game, but I just can't get myself excited to teach and play it again."
28956,126042,6,"Horrible artwork for a dry and expensive game. Low indirect interaction. More sense of civ building in 7wonders. Though the game is tense and easy to teach. Feels like Agricola in the sense that you're always trying to catch up with resources. "

10841,31260,8,"Really solid game with lots of replay value. Stick to 3 or maybe 4 people, and it's also good as a 2-player game.

174003,28143,10,"7 plays - 7/10: it's enjoyable but i don't know where to even begin strategically, which doesn't motivate me to play it again.   10 plays - 8/10: I'd decided to give this a second chance just in case.  I'm definitely enjoying it more as i play it and figure it out more.   15 plays - 9/10: Love it, but the icon system and consume phase are counter-intuitive.  It's also taking me a long time to figure out consume strategies, and i have difficulty playing hands without obvious synergies.   25 plays - 10/10: and there we have it, that says it all.  I now realize the reason it took me a long time to understand and enjoy the game was that my teacher didn't do a great job.  I will be teaching this to many people and they will like it a lot better a lot faster cuz i'll do it right.  67 plays (265 incl. TGS) - 9/10: downgraded this to reflect that despite loving r4tg, TGS is a hell of a lot better.  89 plays (467 incl. TGS/RvI) - 9.9/10: what i should have downgraded it to in the first place, just that i don't really use decimal ratings.  264 plays - 10: remains at this rating. While the base game feels a little simplistic and routine after more than 2,000 plays of various Race formats, it's still the grandaddy/foundation of all variations of by far the best game to date, and therefore an automatic 10."
176997,133473,7,"It seems ok as a simple filler - quick and with so little decisions to make. I would like to try it for more players than 3, though."
74741,65781,4,"Meh.  Not particularly strategically deep, I think.  Money cards at the start of the game are incredibly important.  I liked the forced discard mechanism, but this emphasizes the pasted-on theme. Race for the Galaxy does it so much better.  Limited replayability thanks to the lack of interesting combos and the stacked deck.  "
108206,27627,8,"This new edition is as fun as the old 2nd edition that I played when I was younger.  The only real difference is the high quality components.  This game is extremely luck based but still provides an incredibly thematic gaming experience that is different every time.  I was lucky enough to get one of the advanced copies the first day of GenCon Indy 2007.  Can't wait for expansions."
191459,79828,8,"Limited Edition Signed Copy 128/1000.  [10 plays] I'm very happy with my purchase and pretty darned pleased with how the first play went. There's a lot going on here (rules aren't bad, but the broad palette of options can be daunting at first). I'm really looking forward to playing this a bunch more and the learning and exploring of strategies and tactics.  The components are all great (and I think the basic pieces would be just fine too) and the artwork is nice. The rules are very well done (this is not a typical Wallace strong point). There's a nice amount of angst here, and the theme is well integrated to the gameplay. I love the map. Dang I'm happy with this so far, the more I think about it the more I want to play again right now.  Update 5/13 -- British need to play a bit more like a wargame and France needs to play a bit more like an empire expansion game. Building and maintaining an effective deck may be the most important and most difficult part of playing this game well.  Most recent play Jan '16."

While it is a common problem in many games of this ilk, I admit it's not supremely egregious here.  However, if your play frequency is less than that of others at your table, you will always be at a disadvantage.  So the question comes down to, do you want to memorize all of the tile abilities or not?  I've made my choice. "

I find that both games lack a certain elegance in the mechanics which is common to really good Euro-games. Of the two, however, I'd pick Le Havre over Agricola every time. If the game didn't take so long I'd like it a lot more, but with so many shorter games that provide an equal or greater amount of fun, I don't think this is ever likely to be in my top 10."

An elegant two-player game turns into a rather more chaotic three- or four-player game, but it keeps a nice sense of tension throughout.

Some people are bothered by the randomness of the tile draw, but I don't find it to be worse than any other game with a random element.  It is weird, though, that there is no scaling mechanic for two- or three-player games. Hopefully I won't send people running for the hills when I try to teach it, but it should interest my Samurai-loving friends.  Haven't played this forever, but the iOS version has reminded me why I love it so much. I [u]really[/u] need to get this one out again."
156768,54625,8,"Grandiose, ambitious and glorious, Games Workshop have excelled with this one, its price was peanuts for what came in the box, it is so atmospheric and immersive, you can play forever and you will get a different experience each time."
80660,150312,7,"it just play for do someone mad."
72857,20963,7,"The only problem - and major complaint I have with this game - is that you've got to know the deck well to enjoy it. This could have been circumvented by a page of strategy/tactic hints. I like it, but now that most of my fellow players have been discouraged, I will not play it often."
104930,90137,6,"Only 2-3 plays so far and all of those have been 2-player. I believe this game gets much, much better with 3-4 people so I'll probably re-evaluate my score once I get some experience with that but honestly; it's one of those games that doesn't really stand out terribly. Almost seems doubtful that we'll pick to play this over a lot of other things. Not a bad game though!"
118826,822,8,"Simple yet always so much fun. I love the fact that I can teach this to anyone and it's so easy to pick up yet there's also a lot of strategy and a decent amount of player interaction."
125236,48726,8,"Alien Frontiers turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. I'd heard the comparisons to Troyes, a game I've owned for a while now, and was always glad I had it instead, being as it's touted as the more ""gamer's game"" of the two. But Alien Frontiers turned out to be a lot more different from Troyes than I was expecting.  Area majority plays a huge part (one of my favorite mechanisms), and while having a lighter feel, it almost seems like there are more options on how to use one's dice in this one, especially when playing with the Factions expansion which we also tried this month. The artwork is great, the rules are pretty straightforward, and there are usually at least a few good options every turn.  It's a solid game, and I'm glad that I have both it and Troyes in our collection."
143522,77423,9,"My initial reaction to playing this game was that it seemed kind of interesting and sure had cool artwork on the cards. After getting it in a trade and playing it solo a bunch of times I was ready to give up on it as it seemed impossible to win at. After realizing that this game really needs to be played with two or more players, I fell in love with it and have now acquired quite a few expansions."
115914,2471,6,"Very clunky rules, but kind of fun if played with the fast-play rules posted here on the geek. Can evoke some classic movie moments, or scenes that you could envision in a movie. There is definitely a time and place for this game."
97442,503,7,"A very good game that suffers from a major flaw that affects greatly the pleasure of playing : The pastel colors of camels are the worst effect and demand in order to play in good conditions to have an excellent source of light (headlamp, daylight, ...). What a shame ..."
62939,18602,6,"It is deep. Fantastic design but too dry and long. It doesn't work well for 5 players. "
64576,103,8,"First impression.  Want to play much more!"
83495,74,5,"Can be funny, if everyone plays completely ironically. If you've got one earnest person, then this becomes tedious."
56876,108745,8,"This is another favorite of mine.  I've only played it twice, but I really like how it plays.  I will admit that there is a slight learning curve if you've never played before.  It's difficult in the beginning to know what cards you should take, but after about one play through the game, it becomes easier."
39323,70323,7,"Great filler game that captures the theme of Japanese B-movies to a tee. Adults will prefer the cutthroat competition but even the younger crowd can play."
64828,12333,7,"Excellent condition - Aspirational game for my wife and I and unfortunately, never played.  The pieces are still in original bags. "
133939,31730,7,"i like this game, a train game that doesn't feel ike a train game.  i like how i have shares in all the trains. "
187094,103,8,"Yes, this game plays too long.  Yes, it is fueled in large part by nostalgia.  But, it is still a great game.  With the reprinting by Valley Games, this game should have a shot at breaking the Top 100, but doubtful.  Game Owned:  #1095."
88058,73439,8,"Tons going on in this game. Fun time learning it, and hope to play with 3 or 4 players some day. This is a pretty heavy game though."
97078,65781,8.5,"A very good card-driven game. Card and money management, area control. Multiple options, variety of deployment in order to gain VPs. Excellent art & graphic design of the cards and board-game. "
25657,120677,9,"All components work surprisingly well together for how much is going on. "
152358,136063,8,"Way way way more challenging than Forbidden Island. Very fiddly, though, so be patient.  Different ""doom"" mechanic than FI, but game has a very similar vibe."
130704,15062,7,"First game wasn't too fun, but got more fun after a few games."
121743,42,5.5,"Have played a few times now and feel it's too luck driven on what tiles you draw which would be fine if the game was half as long as it is or there was a way to manage being short of one area but the scoring is based on a balance of all colours so being weak in one area cannot be compensated elsewhere, although there are treasures and monuments they are hotly contested.  The obscure nature of what is a ""good"" action often means that players of different mindsets create odd games where several people think they are taking their best action but its not necessarily true or maybe it is, it's too obscure. Often one or two players get left to their own devices and win or people not paying attention to who needs what colours creates a problem if you don't control someone's weakest area and allow them to run away with the game  The hidden scoring adds to this problem as the colours are taken openly so it's possible to keep track but the game is complex enough that you need to focus on your own strategy quite a lot without enough time to focus on what other players are scoring. It would probably be a better game with open scoring but probably changes the dynamic too much. "
29606,14996,10,"Correcting rating from user malain who put random 1s to a bunch of games for no reason (some hints of racism though) - which was really damaging for the ranking of some unknown games with few ratings."
141003,12002,7,"Hard to judge after one play.  You have to know the cards to enjoy the game."
171249,1294,5,"Edition 2005"
31288,15818,8,"This is just so much fun.  Played with 2 and 4 players.  A surprising amount of decision making for a dice roller.  I picked it up at Essen 05 and spent the rest of the fest just telling everyone to buy it.  Recommended."
183314,19237,8,"Who doesn't like pointing foam guns at each another?  This bluffing game is so much fun, and gets even better with the included variants."
97711,59946,7,"Doesn't last forever, but c'est la vie. Permanent member of collection.   Traded away.  Traded for it back."
361,153938,7,"Light weight gambling fun.  The pyramid is quirky (And fragile) but that's part of what draws people to the game."
121751,39463,10,"Possibly the best iteration of this classic game and one of my all time favorites."
186670,15158,9,"Changes the game/strategy. Makes the game more chaotic."
144924,161970,10,"Brilliant design and play.  Loved it, even as some player were stuck in AP.  There was enough for me to think about that the game just seemed to get better and better.  "
39397,171,8.5,"Great game, but you should always have an opponent of the same playing level, otherwise this game is no fun (no luck element); you can increase your level by studying, but I only like to do so to a certain extent; besides I think the charm of the game is lost with it."
49932,124742,9,"Netrunner is a fantastic asymmetrical game between a Runner ""Hacker"" and Mega Corporations ""Corps"". The back and forth between the Runner and the Corp starts as soon as the game does. Lots of bluffing on both sides with interesting game play on either side. With the LCG format more and more cards are being introduced to the Meta allowing for customized deck building and increasing the variety from match to match.  The Artwork and lots of flavor text on the cards really captures the dystopian ""Cyberpunk"" future.  FFG has really modernized this title and brought it back much better than before."
117136,181,4,"Eh. It's really not as fun as it looks, essentially a child's version of Axis & Allies. A good primer, perhaps, but it's hard to pull it out of the closet after playing other games with more depth.   Quite amusing how some people who have never played the game assume it is one of the most complicated games ever. Not sure why.."
44860,70323,8,"Initial rating is a 9. Why did I give such a simple game this high a rating? Because it's so much FUN! I LOVE LOVE LOVE this game! It's getting a ton of play time right now. Due to this game's high fun factor, quick playing time, ease of rules explanation, and excellent artwork, this has to be one of the best games in my collection. I can play this with anyone. Everyone I have played it with has absolutely loved it. When we get done playing, everyone is always asking for one more game. I don't see myself ever getting tired of it. I love it and can't wait to see if they produce more goodness for this in the future. The game is perfect by itself, but I highly recommend getting the promo cards from the BGG store. They're not necessary for the game to be great, but I'd still say they're a must-have because of how awesome some of them are.  Update: This is going to a 10. I just love this game!"
110693,110327,7.5,"Great game. Love the theme and mechanics. More plays..."
100467,1234,9,"One of the better story telling games due to the way that it forces a creative group narrative. I do not get to play often, but being creative with friends is a blast."
123207,98778,8,"Birthday gift from Derek."
183874,46,7,"One play so far.  I do find the decisions agonizing though.  Not sure if that is good or bad at this point.  We'll see."
19202,2655,8,"AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING!  The only downside to this game, is that is only 2 player, so it doesn't hit the table as often as I'd like."
83808,40834,7,"breathes new life in to a great, but growing stale, game.  mixing the sets really makes dominion shine. rating based on mixing the two sets."
19778,129622,3,"Not much of a game. very few decisions and it takes too long for 4 points. Play to 1 point a few times until the whole group arrives...maybe."
117121,105134,6.1,"The first 5 games were fun.. but then this degenerated quickly into drawn out games that were essentially Risk at their heart.  I think there is a lot of factors that could change the experience for different groups of players.  For us, it became a chore to try and play the complete 15 games and in the end, we didn't finish."
74291,822,6,"Nice gateway game."
165099,148228,8,"good filler. also cities of splendor"
12924,163412,7.5,"I was not expecting much from watching gameplays, but the fun of the game is the puzzle aspect in your mind. You only experience that playing. Good game."
48812,126163,9,"Our first worker placement game. Love the way the wheels work. The play is very smooth and simple, but lots of options and planning ahead. Maybe a little bit unbalanced, but it could  be that certain paths are just easier to execute, while more interesting paths take much more thought and planning. Tight game. We love it. And the components are awesome!"
141300,113924,9,"Captures the Zombie movie feel perfectly. THE go to game for zombie mayhem."
33910,125618,7,"After some number of plays with various variations of players numbers i'm coming to conclusion that this game doesn't live up the somewhat hype it has among other players (at least for me). Yes, it is a step forward from Citadels (which i dislike strongly). But it is still chaotic and unpredictable at times. But the most important thing is that i don't find different roles available fascinating. There are not several good choices in a round. You only have bad, worse and a slightly better choice every time, and often your better choice will be killed/discarded by other players. The game just doesn't satisfy enough to keep selecting roles and play. I have only played online, so i guess that it can rack up another point while playing with a live party of friends, throwing pirate jokes around. And it is ok, but not the most important part of a board game for me."
102012,118,7,"Tastes change.  Played this for the first time in forever and loved it.  Simple auction game where it's very easy to over-value paintings.  5-player game took us about an hour which is slightly longer than ideal, but close.  Will definitely try to get this played more often (but probably not with the kids any time soon)."
186486,31730,5,"Too unforgiving and too dependent on possible 'mistakes' of the other players. Once you fall behind you stay there."
157005,18,8,"This game has the potential for much hilarity, especially when people have trouble envisioning the path."
165326,102794,7.8,"my boyfriend give it to me, but i didn't like it as much as Agricola."
96412,43015,9,"Sweet blend of familiar mechanics makes for a rich strategy game that moves quickly- 60-75 minutes. This will get lots of table time."
106228,27833,8.5,"I simply adores it. Though my gaming group hates it, and thinks its too brain burning.  Includes Expansion: - Steam Barons"
63777,121921,8,"I'm sure that a lot of people will don't forget how they won or dramatically lost their scenarios because the   story settled in their minds (maybe forever) and not many non--rpg can do that . Highly recommended "

26766,33160,8,"Played this once in a game group...and LOVED it.  I'm interested to see how it flies in ""non-gaming"" circles..."
114260,24480,7.8,"Fairly well balanced worker placement game.  I like it, goes over well with my wife which is a plus in my book.  Recommend it if you can still find it."
176239,1294,9,"Cool classic game"
106802,17226,8,"I would love to have a great dungeon crawl game in my collection, but it's kinda large to have around and I wouldn't usually have anyone to play with"
178693,12,9,"Excellent bidding game. I found the scoring difficult to keep straight, until I started using the place mats found here on the geek. Now I can't imagine trying to learn the game without them. Not only do they help you keep track of your stuff, but they also allow you to quickly assess your opponent's position.  Best with three players, IMO."
47928,194655,10,"One of the best perfect information games.  Best as a  2-player game, but  very good with 3 or 4 too."
193115,4390,7.75,"Some variation to the original game, but not enough to warrant buying both unless you really like Carcassonne.  I prefer the original one to this."
104929,70919,7,"100% Wife Approved - one of the very few games she's wanted to play multiple times in a row"
154990,503,7.5,"Hunted this down for a while but finding it a bit...meh...at the moment. Maybe more plays will bring it to life but its more likely to get traded."
59400,59294,8,"Play to experience. Jason"
119849,3955,7,"Not much fun for the renegade, but fortunately, I've never pulled that role.  :)"
98809,27173,8,"Definitely an underrated game.  Probably plays best using the progress tiles without the auction."
152427,140,8,"fun. family friendly. loud. pretty great."
17581,2993,8,"I think this expansion really improves the original game.  There's a lot more strategy in terms of when to employ the ""double-or-nothing"" pieces.  Also, I like the big meeple (or ""The Deuce"" as my game group calls it) and the tension in when to deploy it, and the feeling that it makes no city safe from take-over."
66972,43443,7,"Good game that becomes much better with the Wizard's tower"
51553,92415,9,"Arguably the quintessential bluffing game with a nice push your luck element involved in the bidding. Each turn is tense and hilarious. not to mention, it's SO SIMPLE. Are there better games that involve a bluffing element? Yes. Are there better simple bluffing games? Nope."
105183,148228,9,"Found it a bit dry after the first play, but it grew on me and became really addictive, as I saw the subtleties of the game."

158836,13,3,"Up there with the most disappointing games I have ever tried. It has almost everything I hate in boardgamaing - it's random, it's too long, it has something reminiscent of player elimination (if people cut you off, you're toasted)... Played it just once, but it was a horrible experience (although the guy who was lucky with dice rolls for almost the entire game was having fun). And the haggling element... ugh!"
51823,13,3,"I know, this is supposed to be a great game and probably it is.  However, I did not enjoy the times I played it.  I felt it had too much of a runaway leader problem, one of my pet peeves in game design.  In other words, I felt that it was clear after a few rounds who would win and who would lose and catching up was hard to do.  Maybe one day with the right group I will give it a second look, but there are other games I would rather play."
75940,28143,9,"Same problems as San Juan... just when the game becomes interesting and you have your various economic engine pieces in place, it's over!  Five player variant (use counters for goods instead of cards, have an extra set of roles) works well."
174078,93,7,"Only played twice but really liked it and can see lots of replayability in this one.  Hopefully futures plays will reinforce this feeling."
157377,100901,7.5,"I love playing this one with my girlfriend. Quick and fun."
62997,11,4,"Oldest shuffles, player to left of dealer starts."
84136,25554,9,"Very nice game to play."
93654,3076,10,"My favorite game.  Puerto Rico has an excellent mix of strategy and tactics, it moves fairly quickly, and it regularly presents interesting decisions.  This game hooked me on the first play, and even though it's one of my most played games, I still enjoy every play."
139228,126163,9,"Pros: Neat twist on worker placement. Brain burner - the timing of placing guys and picking them up on the correct spot requires careful planning.  Cons: Strategies seem limited to the 4 technology tracks, which may hinder replayability."
178701,143884,4,"like new, cards show little to no wear, played 4-5 times, no insert but cards will be packed into small container that fits it + the tokens/dice"
14591,69789,8,"Bought this at Origins 2013."
55366,29368,7,"Great game! Heavily favored towards the zombies (especially in the advanced scenarios). The modular board makes for a new map every time."
81106,475,6.5,"Out of Print (OOP)."
118040,14996,8,"For gamers, this is a much more interesting variation that requires a little more planning and less dumb luck.  The Long Tickets are still the fatal flaw though, and possibly worse in this game as you rapidly learn what they are."
127436,101721,8,"Easily one of the best games I have played. This is the way a battle between magicians should be simulated. The game flows very well once you know your deck and doesn't take too long. The core set offers a lot of different strategies to try out but eventually expansions will be needed. Will probably get everything that will be released for this game.  Added an extra Core Set."
165013,70919,7.4,"- 2-4 player - Weight: Medium-Light - Genre: Family - Length: Medium  Cute, easy to learn, and has beautiful components. It's a fun, albeit simple game that we would recommend for any family. "

9767,503,6,"I'd rather play GO, has nice components though"
158924,178900,9,"Great fun and a wonderful game to play when waiting for other games to finish up. It is very easy to add and drop players and plays well from 3 to 8."
140291,43111,10,"Full of theme and plenty of fun! "
76338,107529,8,"Best with 4 players Recommended with 2, 3, 4 players  (32 voters)"
112630,28143,9,"Holy smokes...this game has so many options and possibilities.  Just the text on all the cards makes my head hurt.  It isn't that hard, but with so much going on with all the cards, it's easy to forget bonuses that certain cards provide.  I am definitely looking forward to playing this one a lot more.  I love worlds added by the first expansion...gives the game a lot more strategic depth.  ***All RftG face to face plays, even those using expansion cards, are recorded under the base game.  Now with an excellent computer version of the game, my rating has gone up to 8.5."

167471,105,6,"Points of interest for this game would the  bidding/secret bidding on your favorite creatures, using their abilities and trying to stomp the competition.  The hindrances would be that the game is probably to chaotic with 4 and 5 players, the Ettin seems too be too strong with a lower player count, and finally since you don't use the same creatures from game to game, there's a lot of sorting to do before putting the game away.  This seems like a lot of negative things to say but I still enjoy playing the game and it feels like a unique experience."
28134,9217,8,"I like it.....one of my first board games. Seems the buildings are a little to powerful, but a short alternative to my favorites."
33002,65244,3,"Mmmaaaargh! Mind numbing co-op ""action"". Nice components and the game comes in a tin box. That's where the good ends.."
159293,129622,9,"Original and wedding version. "
102708,27162,6,"It may just have been the group I played the first game with, but this game seems to induce AP. Being an analytical person myself, I usually don't complain about long turns, but one player in my game at bgg.con got yelled at (by his wife, fortunately) for taking 15 minutes to do his turn; while she might not have timed it precisely, sadly it wasn't enough of an exaggeration to qualify as hyperbole.  Apparently there are few enough possibilities that some people think they can calculate them all, but enough options that they really can't - at least not in a reasonable time. If this becomes a pattern, I may I need to either play only with math geeks who can do simple combinatorics in their head quickly, or bring a timer."
30564,48726,8,"Looking forward to playing this game some more to solidify my opinion, but I very much enjoyed my first play. Great mix of area majority and worker placement. The Alien Tech cards and dice add just enough chaos to the game to make it interesting."
13956,66188,7.4,"It's a typical Euro for its time of release. Its theme could be easily changed to something producing/building and then it would be really a generic euro of the past years. The theme makes the difference and that makes it more enjoyable."
74927,12942,6,"Birthday gift, 2011  Ludicrously simple, but with an interactive push-your-luck element that makes it special. This is a game that I can play with anyone and not feel bored or irritated.  The only downside is that we managed to lose one of those tiny little red chips within the first five minutes of our first game, and so now have to use a penny. C'mon, ZMan, why couldn't you have included two or three extra chips?"

45777,55660,8,"Nice illustration as always!  (Note: all plays are recorded under the base game.) "
100326,24480,7.5,"High churn game. I like this better than most, or I'm getting used to the genre."
27887,2452,6.5,"Fantastic game for the younger folks.  My kids have not played it much since they were twelve or so."
56319,9209,8.5,"We don't play it as much as we used to but when we do it is still fun."
79773,9674,7,"Probably my favorite abstract game."
144085,4390,9,"I actually think this is better than Carcassonne! While in Carcassonne you need a couple of expansion for the game to take off, here it's fun in the simple way it's presented. It plays a lot faster and it feels like you have a lot more to do than in Carcassonne. Well, I guess I just like this better ..."
60863,2163,10,"I love this game, but have trouble getting anyone I know to play it.  Oh well, sometimes I get it out and play a scenerio alone just for fun. If you like games and the movie Alien, check into this bit of sci-fi board-fare. "
51601,157354,7,"Really fun game.  Don't like the theme as much (not into magic - djinn or using slaves).  Artwork top notch. "
1392,13,6,"I played all the time online, finally got to play in person.  The game is a bit too much luck based for me (I need luck in a game to really enjoy it, but this game is like 90% luck).  It's fun with the family, but it really feels like anyone can win at any time.  Because the robber can seriously cripple people with a lead (and more times than not the table will roll 7's like crazy and if you were the first one in a large lead, they'll just destroy you and not even realize when others are in the lead).  It's funny, but frustrating when you're on the ugly side of it.  So, fun for the family (so long as no one's a sore loser), but not a gamer's game."
17735,102794,9,"I am really enjoying this game.  Replacing the cards from Agricola with the buildings that are open to everyone is a nice change that brings more balance to the game (although planning your cards in Agricola is a lot of fun).  Questing is an interesting mechanism as well.  Have played with 5 players and 3 players.  5 players was a tight game that had a similar feel to Agricola.  3 players was much looser than I remember Agricola being at that player count."

157562,122515,7.7,"Tentative rating based on one play.  Nice, very innovative game (though Asara done one-color worker placement earlier). And very fiddly.  The whole game is fun. But - after the game you don't feel like you've acomplished ""something"". Pushed some cubes here and there, turned around some tiles. No turning points, no really heavy tension. I don't know. Nevertheless - check it out. Some innovative stuff is there, but (I think) it all lacks final development by the external publisher."

154394,136888,6,"OK filler if played fast"
3375,92828,5.5,"for me this game really shines when played with people you don't know so much because you can gain an insight into their minds, or with people you know and do not play it with them often (after a while certain associations are created and fixed and then it's just not that fun). the best thing about this game is the conversations that explain who selected which card and why. i think that the scoring isn't really necessary and it's more fun to just play it for the stories you can create. best thing is, when you go on holiday with people who usually don't play board games you don't need to take the box with you, just take the cards alone, play it as you like and have fun. really only downside is, that it can get repetitive quickly"

7765,134342,10,"Lords of Waterdeep is my favourite pure worker placement game. I don't feel like I will ever need another game in the genre."
60113,3201,10,"By far my favorite Reiner Knizia game. A perfect blend of the abstract and the thematic."
45233,15987,7,"Really liked this but it took too long to set up and play.  If I ever have 3 hours to play a board game, I'm almost certainly choosing Mage Knight, so reluctantly sold this to hopefully a good home where it will get more love."
42131,138161,10,"Roam around the galaxy completing missions."
160507,826,8,"A pretty cool little game about pirates escaping from jail. There are just two simple rules and one victory condition, but strategy is important!  (Of course, on the first two plays, I screwed up one of those two rules. Oh, well.)"
138000,65244,10,"A very good co-op for families and lighter gaming groups. I wouldn't bring to my gamers game night but I can play this with my wife which is a big plus."
93912,204583,7,"This is a quick game that is perfectly suited for kids, but seems to have some good strategy in it too.  It seems (3 games in) to have a surprising amount of depth considering how fast it is, as you have to make decisions around best pieces, how to fit them, and denying your opponent. It's satisfying to domino your pieces together too.  "
108997,172225,9,"Simple and fun game. Even more fun with Imploding Kittens. Most people rate it at 6 because they play this game in a wrong way. 2-5 players is not the top performance spot of this game. From my experience I recommend 6-8 players and this is the way party game work."
28772,144733,8,"I like this game, but I have a feeling that it might be nearly ""solved.""  I thought the trans-Siberian might be dominant, but I was beaten by the Kiev/factory strategy when the third player also went for the trans-Siberian.  I think it was due to the lack of competition in the factories rather than competition in the trans-Siberian.  The problem lies in that to execute the trans-Siberian requires a full commitment for the whole game or it won't be effective.  So the game might come down to which strategies people commit to at the beginning of the game.  The person with the least competition wins.  Fortunately, I like playing this game to see if my theory holds.  Unfortunately, it is hard to find opponents that are at the same level of experience."
24732,3,7,"Combat is like 'Go' with different valued pieces.  Game play is improved with a strong intuition.  Small advantages can be magnified by inducing 'ties' on combat results."

61584,2381,7,"This is a fun party game which is good for some laughs (at least in our family). CAn get old kind of fast, but I really like it as a filler."
61465,90419,7,"May go up after additional plays. A very tight and balanced design."
51610,25292,7,"NOTE: Game might have changed from prototype!  Impressions after two games:  Overall: Fun! Manages to capture the feel of sailing the seas, of pirating and trading very well. Lots of theme, lots of cards with texts on them, lots of dice, too.   Risk-taking is a big part of the game, and it can be really nasty: Storms force you around, wars prevent you from trading where you wanted to, and of course, big baddy Blackbeard had to attack you, of all ships.  However, bad things happen to everyone (there's a whole lot of fun watching the trouble of other players), and even after a series of bad rolls and card draws, or after dying three times (as I did in my second game), you might still win in the end.  Even so, if you can't live with temporary (random) setbacks, the game is probably not for you.  The game mechanics are simultaneous action selection (which direction am I going to sail? Or would I rather go to port, scout for ships to combat, or try to follow another ship?), commodity demand by randomly drawing chits, random events from a card deck, and rumor cards that the players draw.  You have lots to do and decide. Am I going to be pirate or trader? Am I going to pursue a rumor, or rather try to make money by trading or sinking merchant ships? Should I upgrade the ship I have, or rather save the money for a better ship? And so on.  I'd love to play it again...  UPDATE: Published version, played one two-player and one three-player game. Although some rules have changed, the feel of the game is still the same, and I see my current rating confirmed.  UPDATE 2: The game did lose some flavor as compared to the beta version, but it plays a lot shorter. Luck can be a massive factor. The fact that now players can turtle from harbor to harbor means that in some cases, lucky players are hard to attack, and therefore can reach their 10 glory points rather quickly."
118836,34635,8,"Very good light family euro with dice"
32664,36218,7,"The original deckbuilding game with very easy rules but also a lot of replayability and depth. Good gateway game. I recommend that if you like it, you should definitely get couple of expansions since they add so much more cards to play and variety. The reason why I give it only 7 is because it is quite light on strategy when you have played it a lot (experienced players usually go for the same 4-5 cards) and my group has definitely ""exhausted"" it with probably 50+ games (same with Carcassonne)."
170165,21523,7,"Brilliant progression, but it takes far to long and therefore does not get played enough. Still haven't found the game that can replace it."
185082,123260,7.5,"A city building game. It always lasts just a little too long for my tastes, and there are rules and details I have to look up every single time I play! It just isn't intuitive to me. In the game's defense it seems well designed even if my brain isn't."
54268,463,10,"I no longer play, but it will always hold a special place for me. I was a big MtG junkie for many many years, but friends move away and times change. The bulk of my collection has since been sold off. Recently I've been able to trade many of my old cards online to build my board game collection. I still have plenty of cards to build decks with if I ever wanted to play again.  I've waffled on the rating for this one. It's not something I play anymore and don't want to play all the time, so by the BGG definition it's probably a 6. However, I LOVED this game for years and have so many fond memories from it, I think I have to give it a 10, a sort of lifetime achievement award. That feels right."
90923,25292,6,"Good theme play.  Game easy to learn and play, some fiddly rules.  Game plays OK.  Would like to see the NPCs move much more.  Game seems too focused on buying and selling of goods whether playing a pirate or a merchant.  Excellent combat system but I don't care for the PvP aspect.  Playing a Merchant is dull.    The game components are excellent - mounted board (although a dull color scheme), plastic playing pieces, fairly durable cards.  Game length is about 2 hours but feels alright."
115158,1927,6,"sale at 3 euro's, gave it way"
191116,91312,6,"Sort of feels like the Lords of Waterdeep of area control games. It's very simple, but almost to the point of being able to play on autopilot. At the same time, I think fans of the source material will really enjoy this. There was just a little too much junk rattling around and not enough control for me to want to hang onto this over others in the same genre. Especially since the board feels so wide open that there isn't much tension on who will control what."
27003,5,6,"Considered by many to be THE stock market game, at which it succeeds. However, may be too abstract for many of the players in my group."
80659,18,5,"Glad I finally tried this. As I suspected, it's not really my kind of game, what with my poor spatial reasoning and dislike of too much randomness in games. I appreciate the design, but not my thing."
44483,7854,8.5,"This game is like a mix of omok and othello. Love it!"
175989,103885,8,"Takes forever to set up, but this game is gorgeous in its execution and simple in its execution.  While I'm getting a little sick of the metagame and the not-from-the-movies sets, that's MY issue, not the game's.  I always want to play another game once my game is over."
100115,194655,8,"Rating at 8 for now. Some gods seem stronger than others by a noticeable margin but more plays may change that. Beautiful production and quick gameplay are huge pluses here.  [b]Golden Fleece[/b]"
112124,70919,8,"There's tile placement, abilities and three different way to score. Easy gateway game for all ages, marvelous illustrations and the BEST PANDA miniature EVER. "
56726,11,8,"I enjoy this.  Love the interactivity and negotiating that goes on.  2-player variant just seemed way to random.  Didn't care for it much at all."
101885,22545,5,"A mish mash of mechanics that you've seen a billion times before. But if you can deal with the sameness of it, it definitely entertains."

154441,13004,7,"Wonderful family or casual game, simple but deep. "
22857,97207,7,"Worker placement with a whole lotta luck depending upon what cards are drawn. Decent design, but doesn't really sing to me. Board is a bit busy and unclear. Still, the pets are fun, thematic, and adorable."
21885,463,7,"Sold all my cards long ago.  It was the first CCG, so it certainly had a lot of problems with design which were corrected by later CCGs.  The best thing it has going for it is that everybody knows it, and so that will occasionally get me to play."
148676,13,8,"My family's favorite go to game.  Got us started playing euro games 3 years ago and we still enjoy it immensely. "
48679,18602,8,"A game for a king. Maybe requiring a bit dry thinking, but also dynamic and interesting."
98495,70323,8.5,"A fun and light-hearted dice rolling game about giant monsters battling in a city.  Great flavor, a ton of fun and a great game for new games and kids to get into gaming with.  Despite that there is enough to the design that you can strategize, and enough variance from the dice and cards that anyone can win."
52258,37759,6.9,"A fun 'push your luck' game with a good poker face required!"
101987,84876,7.5,"Less players the better in my experience. Player interaction and a fun pressure ramps up nicely when there are less tiles to grab.  Maybe just a phase too long as there was little to really do or get excited by the 20th turn, other than scrape in a couple of extra points which, if you've smart players in your group (me not included) is meaningless as they'll have shot ahead on the points track with no hope in catching them. The theme and visuals are very very bland indeed and you'll often be checking references to figure out which buildings do what. They are far too plain to be recognisable at a glance.  That aside, I still enjoyed the mechanics of this immensely. Very smooth and satisfying gameplay."
60935,172,7.5,"Nice and quick playing, easy to teach, good combination of luck and strategy.  I can imagine settling on a particular way to play this after awhile, but at present its quite a lot of fun, and quick enough to get in several games in a row."
121866,59294,7,"An interesting one this one... In some ways it's a war game but ultimately victory relies on the sub game of the questing. I can't really put my finger on how I feel about that yet... I think it was a good idea to put the game into the same world as Descent. Production is good although I'm not sure it really needed to be in the epic sized box. Based on one play as the vanilla humans."
147741,8098,3,"I liked this game a lot better the first time when it was called Egyption Rat Screw, and you played it with a regular deck of cards, and it didn't suck. I guess it's amusing that the cards are purposely similar to trick you, but then it's also amusing that a Stanford sports team is named after a color rather than some animal, but that doesn't mean I like football."
161797,2993,8,"Adds a bit more flavor to the classic and the uber-meeple, too."
38487,1294,4,"Holds up better than a lot of older board games, but still not actually all that good. Mystery of the Abbey and Scotland Yard are better deduction games, and I know there are others I haven't played yet. That said: were I trapped in a cabin for a week with just Monopoly, Risk, Life and Clue, I'd play a metric gripload of Clue."
27067,132531,8,"Engine building, Dice (but still controlled randomness), what's not to like? Glorious Game!"
184454,66589,8,"At first I ranked this below Hamburgham but now I rank it above.  There is not very much interaction but it is a good optimization game."
96605,105551,2,"i really wanted to like this game, but this game is broken. or perhaps we played it wrong. but if we played it wrong, then the author made a very bad job writing the rules."

189543,3955,2,"Game provides a lot of incentive to gang up on one player (whether they're winning or not) and once you're out, you get the pleasure of twiddling your thumbs and counting dots on the ceiling while waiting for the game to conclude so you can play something else.  Yay!"

34093,9217,8,"Clever, easy and nice game. Good for gateway."
99618,171,8.8,"A very cool looking chess set - basic cardboard board, but the pieces are really neat looking and, rather importantly to me, very durable. The only downside is that the cave trolls - bishops for the black side - are a bit on the large side, and can kind of be annoying to move around. Still, a nice chess set for everyday play if you're a Lord of the Rings fan."
103562,2591,10,"This makes the basic game so much better."
44459,1406,1,"Didn't even like this, you know, back then. Baseline for misery."
70764,24480,6,"I thought it'd be something much more better. I mean more strategy game. I can see fun, but for me it's kind of boring. Not too many strategies to choose. I can't even build anything.   Of course it was worth to play just for the sake of its mechanics when placing builders. Player who started this round takes randomly from the black sack one builder. It can be his color or someone else. Then he puts it on a free (7th space) of a something like a clock... This player can pay seven and place his builder somewhere on the board, or just pass. I think I'd play it again just for that part of the game... ;)"
33721,164153,7,"Didn't like this game at first- though we played with only 2 players. But with 5 players at the table, it changed my view. The game is good!  "
37147,27708,8,"Punched, bagged, played once.  No insert."
13728,136063,8,"I feel like this is the gamers version of Forbidden Island. It takes everything and kicks it up a notch. One of the best co-op games I own. "
99743,84876,7.3,"After one play, I can see why it's so well regarded -- a lot of strategies to try, and seems very well balanced (I managed to squeak out a win by 2 points, having only built 2 buildings, but was only one mine away from filling up and taking small or large bonus for everything else).    There's a lot going on, and a lot to learn, but the iconography helps a lot once you figure it out.  It would be nice if the buildings were more distinctive.  The setup and cleanup time are quite long.  I'd love to play again, but ultimately, I very rarely have the opportunity to play a game that takes longer than 45-60 min, so it's unlikely to happen again anytime soon."
107623,70323,9,"Monsters haven't been so much fun till I played KoT. The question that I never answer right seems to be when should I get out of Tokyo!"
100050,93,9,"The daddy of all area control games.  I think it might be a little too chaotic with five, but I played with three and fell in love with it.  The castille really makes the game; having that hidden scoring and last-minute chance to affect the board really brings a lot of tension to the game."
10849,926,7,"I actually really enjoyed this when we played, but the people who are interested in Settlers don't really want to make it this hardcore and the people who are interested in playing something that's 2 hours and a more serious game would rather play Agricola or Glory to Rome or Castles of Burgundy."
28559,13,7,"Settlers of Catan with either the Cities and Knights expansion or the Helpers of Catan expansion is one of our all-time favorites; either bumps the rating up a notch. (Note that Star Trek Catan is the same game but with different theme AND the Helpers of Catan included.)"
141127,110327,8,"I play this weekly.  For almost 6 months I've enjoyed this game.  ALWAYS played with the expansion.  I don't know how it plays without and won't ever know.  4 stars amazing game."
160591,71,8,"Those college days! My actual plays of this game were more than a decade ago. But at that time it was the best game I ever played and I would jump on a game whenever I get the opportunity. Which is not very likely to show up soon. After all, getting 7 players to spend 10hrs+ on a single game is not an easy endeavour."
142487,22141,7,"Rating after 1 play.  Quite a bit of luck but fun.  I gifted a copy to a friend."
180796,102680,10,"Extremely difficult but highly rewarding."
151608,1234,7,"The fact that there are two very different ways to interrupt stories often confuses people, but once you get over that hump, the game is a blast.  Also, make sure to enforce the ""one one card per sentence"" and ""you can't leave open holes in the story before you end it,"" rules to make it more difficult for a runaway leader to emerge."

80659,34635,6,"To me, it feels like there's nothing going on in this game. Maybe I just don't like dice, but it feels too swingy to me. It's not light enough to be a filler but not heavy enough to be satisfying. There are so many medium-complexity games that I would rather play.  UPDATE: After my second play, I upgraded this to a 6. I still stand by my original statement that it's not light enough to be a filler, but it's too heavy to be so dependent on dice. Still, maybe winning my second game had something to do with it, but I am willing to play this once in a while."
126241,155426,8.3,"Really enjoyable group game, quite easy to play.   Scoring is a bit tricky, but offset by the beautiful quality of the rooms."
128356,42,8,"A great game -- it's quite simple but it remains very deep.  I really enjoy the scoring mechanic that forces you to play for balance.  More confrontational than most games, which keeps things interesting.  I would rate it higher, but the theme feels a bit pasted-on, and as a more abstract game, the randomness in the tile draws can be frustrating."
60871,760,9,"Light."
9902,18602,8,"I have seen this described as a game of 'perfect information'. Whilst it is not quite that, it is a game which rewards skill and experience. In this respect, it has the potential to stand alongside the classic  strategy games. Time will tell."
124450,21523,7,"Only a couple of plays, very fun, and may grow on me as I learn the mechanics better."
36306,699,7,"There's just so much nostalgy included in this one. I remember playing it a lot back then. If I played this now it would probably turn out to be a bit too simple and contain a lot of illogical rules. So better keep it nostalgic!  Descent is the Heroquest of today and so much more, so I'll stick to that. "
154718,2243,5,"What to do when you have nothing to do."
64180,15062,7,"Still a good game but my love of it has waned over the years. I think I've just kind of had my fill of it by now."
122618,54,7,"Not bad but a bit too much downtime with more players and gets too repetitive with only 2 players. Not a fan of the set collection treasure. "
147732,15987,1,"I thought this was an interesting game.  It was kind of fun.  But tended to drag and get repetitive after a while.  There was also a descent amount of downtime in the game.    I only got one play with seven players though.  I'd be interested in trying it with less players probably next time.  Might also make it a little more challenging, as the group didn't seem to be in very much danger during our game."
123111,11170,9,"Initial ranking after a few first games (8).  My sons loved it.  I think the rating will go up with more plays.  Great theme, no downtime, simple rules, a fair amount of luck to make the game slightly unpredictable and lots of FUN.   One more note.  The customization aspect of this game is awesome.  If you have other miniatures, it is very easy to write your own army cards and invent custom rules.    One of the advantages of Heroscape is that, you can customize it to fit your needs.  By capping the army limit, you control the game length.  By building your own map and choosing one of many scenarios, you make each game different.    The possibilities are overwhelming considering such simple rules.  An important note.  This game is ADDICTIVE. If you like it, you will soon want to have all the expansions and figures.  Multiple sets are required to build impressive maps, otherwise you will feel a little disappointed by comparing your designs with the photos on Heroscapers. I am not yet at this point, as this hits your pocket hard, but I think that I will try to complete the collection and have at least one unit of each available.  With +70 games played, I have upgraded the ranking to 10, because the game deserves it.  In contrast to many eurogames, each game tells a story and you can actually remember battles even after several weeks.      Remember: buy at least TWO from each COMMON SQUAD expansion pack.  Certain units simply play better when you have more figures and it is easier to control your army when you have fewer army cards on your side.  -1 for setup time."

87624,62871,5,"Fun filler, but no player interaction and minimal decisions."
146456,187645,7,"Played once, really enjoyed it and clearly a well designed game.  I love it when games incorporate thematic storytelling elements seamlessly into game play mechanisms. This game does that all over the place and it really creates the feeling of playing out the movies.  Whilst the game is 11 out of 10 for theme, it felt like only a 6 or 7 out of 10 for creating interesting game play decisions. A lot of the game play is pretty simple and the combat in particular feels a little light for my tastes.  Had fun and would play again, but didn't leave me with a ""must play again"" feeling."
168558,136063,7,"Fun to play cooperative game. Light and easy but nice change of pace from time to time. "
192669,24480,8.2,"Excellent game.  Plays very well with 2, 3 or 4. "

154975,45315,7,"Unusual game that I've only played once, so I'm not quite sure what to think about it. Basic theme is creating nasty dungeons for various heroes to try their luck (you being the dungeon lord). Very original, but strange. "

There's no set collection and you're not really building a network.

Playing with multiple players gives a greater mix of tactics to dilute the luck. The excellent expansion adds a ton of stuff to the mix, making it a much more hectic and exciting game.

Getting stuck with the same combo for 2 turns its a recipe for disaster. You have to constantly change ad adapt your strategy, embrace chaos and dig into those decks!

System could be adapted quite easy for improvements which I will try but overall this will get a rating no higher than 6 as I see it and maybe a 5 with no changes.  Update: Well I finally got to play this and yeah it is quite dated. It's really a cool system bringing the D&D basics to a board game that I would have loved when I was like age 7 to 12 (albeit when this came out I was already too old to really enjoy it) which is really the age group I recommend it for, adults should look elsewhere like WHQ.   The base game is quite limited w/o expansions as there are only 14 quests included although you could easily design more. Really a neat little system but not enough variety to be interesting for adults, every game feels the same and there is is no meat on the system its just WAY too basic.   House rules could improve this rating as could expansions but with better choices around why bother. High raters influenced by nostalgia should really update their ratings and comments as to not mislead people.   => sold"

I like how the 4 gods have different yet conflicting powers and victory strategies; they mesh quite well together and create some interesting tension.

I like the mechanical additions to the base game. I like that the strategy is a little more complex than in the original. What I don't like is the end game. The original often leads to a frantic ending where 2-3 (and occasionally 4) people are vying for the last key spot or trying to get those last one or two points to win. The ending in Cities often seems preordained. "

123657,1294,6.3,"The Simpsons Edition "
47153,31594,7,"Im Jahr des Drachen is the newest alea game, so of course it had to be on my play list. Stefan Feld is apparently alea's in-house designer as of late, and I enjoy both of his previous games, Und Ru(h)m und Ehre and Notre Dame. I think Im Jahr is the best of his alea series to date though.  Im Jahr is a game of adversity. At the most baseline level, you're trying to build buildings, get people to put in them, and keep everyone alive. This is made difficult in various ways by the Cossacks (Mongols actually, but the swords look Cossack-like), the plague, droughts (with damage prevented by coarse-ground cocaine tacos), and the incredibly deadly king/emperor/ruler type of your choice (who will kill many more people than the Cossacks if you fail to grovel adequately).  Each round is based on two major halves. The first half, each player can select an action from a menu of X where X is equal to the number of players. Multiple people can select the same action, but they have to pony 3 bucks if someone else is already there. The actions each give you things like victory points, or chips that generate victory points, or chips which help you to avoid unpleasant events.  The second part of the game involves drafting personality tiles off the board. These tiles allow the actions you take in the first half of each round to be more efficient. They also give you points on the sub-track, which determines player order, and which tends to be very important if you aren't rolling in the cash.  After that, an event occurs, most of which are negative, and most of which involve losing people if you can't fend it off. The events are all laid out at the start of the game, so you can see what is coming, and everyone is likely to be dinged by something at some point in time.   The end game scoring is the usual alea mish-mash with a tonne of things generating VPs, i.e.: the buildings you have put up, the number of people you have, points you've accrued throughout the game for having buildings, points you've accrued throughout the game for having bonus point scrolls, &c.  I think this game fits together well, and I enjoy the tough choices and the ability to look ahead at the events and craft a game length strategy. In some senses, people have been comparing it to Notre Dame in that it is a game where it is nice to have strong infrastructures in place so that one can take actions with increased efficiency and get a bigger return, but it's impossible to do everything well, and the order the events come out in seems like it will dictate some strategic choices.  My only real reservation about this game is my feeling that with a cash heavy infrastructure (i.e.: a couple of the coin-makers) you can almost ignore what the other players are doing. The only real interaction in the game is based on the battle for scarce actions, which is the major angst in the first half of the round, and also partially dictates person tile choice in the second. Cash allows you to effectively buy the action you want for 3, and to take the person tiles you want without paying much attention to the turn order sub-track. Not every game will make cash a sound choice, so this is a niggle, but so it goes.   I like the game though, and I would like to play it some more to form a more solid opinion on it. This might have a hard ceiling on it where players can craft certain strategies for certain event sequences (i.e.: when this event occurs early do this...&c.) but that's complete speculation on my part. At this point, I enjoy, would be willing to play it anytime, but don't need to own it. 7 for starters."

120127,31481,10,"This game is ridiculously awesome. It has two problems:  - It's less fun if players have different skill levels. Although the game has a silly, somewhat random feel, it rewards skill overwhelmingly.  - If you get too good at it, your ship often doesn't suffer much damage at all.  Both these are helped quite a bit by the Big Expansion, which lets you increase the difficulty and allows handicaps. "

Also read one rating that said that they'd rather play ""Skat"". I also am a fan of Skat ( considered the ""Chess"" of card games)but Skat to me is ""Straightforward"". Just the ""so-called"" complicated bidding of Skat is supposed to make it a superior game compared to its actual gameplay is a farx.

I'm less fond of four-player games, partly due to the greater chaos between turns (though this can be mitigated with team play), but more due to the fact that card stacks run out so quickly that ""teching up"" via dogma effects becomes very weak.  Players seem to first get better at this game by learning basic principles (""more icons is good""), learning what cards/powers exist, and being less overwhelmed and so better able to spot advantageous combos.

We played the basic game about 10 times before moving on to the more advanced game (which is included in the box, thats a plus), I think that was about right it makes you appreciate the subtle differences the extra tiles give the game.  Need to try and play with more players. I think the fact that the game is called Vikings but there is no combat, puts some people off."
191051,98,6.5,"While a pretty fun game, there&#039;s not much history there.  I mean, let&#039;s face it, the best chance the Axis have to win is by the Japanese driving across Siberia and/or the Hindu Kush and Himalayan Mts. and driving on the Russian capital.  Yeah, like the Japanese really considered that.  And too much emphasis on the dice; a couple of bad rolls at crucial times, and you are really screwed, but I guess you could make that argument for a lot of games (we implemented a suggested variant from &quot;Moves&quot; magazine that really cut down on the luck factor).  But still a fun beer and pretzels game.  Cool bits, and not a bad way to introduce newbies to the hobby of strategy gaming.  I understand that A&amp;A Europe is better.  "

160719,21523,7,"A good addition to the Fantasy Game Genre but requires lots of tweaks to keep it from growing long and dull. I like it best with 2 people and wouldn't really play with 3 or 4.  It works solo which is ok.  Epic, grand adventures, not really a 'play to win' type of game but an experience.  Wonderful expansions.  Lots of options/cards to tailor the game to your liking and lots of good variants posted around here to help you streamline play.  The threat track is a must to keep the game fresh.  I like to play with 3 market stacks (1-4; 5-9; 10+; use a 1d3 to determine a stack for a random draw)and 3 starting cards in each market (blind) with a market draw from the players choice of stacks (depending on what they can afford).  In addition to that I like the starting equipment variant and the three points to advance variant.  Those are just a couple of things you can do to really help speed the game along and keep the playing time reasonable. Lastly, this should really be played as a co-op game, playing this game competitively feels like a real expense of time.    Ultimately, I prefer Citadel of Blood, DeathMaze, Prophecy, Return of the Heroes, or Magic Realm.  Expansions all sold. Base game sold.  "

117216,14105,9,"Unit variation and a good card set make this a game where you'll be thinking about manoeuvring your units to outflank and break your opponent up. Keeping your troops together in line and adjacent to leaders with effective use of different unit types keeps you thinking. The hand management is vital - setting up a powerful combination for an attack that you'll be able to carry through with - more important than in Memoir 44.  After a couple of games the rules become very clear and you'll find yourself breezing through scenarios without referencing rules or reference sheets.  I'm extremely interested in the history here - there are some fantastic podcasts and documentaries on these battles and the strategies, tactics, unit makeups and leadership behind it all. I prefer games over simulations, and while I wouldn't want too many games this streamlined, what it lacks in minute detail it makes up for with pure gaming fun.  I thought initially this would be too similar to Memoir 44 for me to own both, but after playing both in the same week I see room for both in my collection. Good stuff and I actually quite like the blocks."

119417,24068,7,"A game of hidden roles. There are three factions: Shadows, Hunters and Neutrals.  For Shadows and Hunters things are simpler: to win they must destroy to other side. The Neutrals have different agendas, and can achieve victory in a number of ways: from just staying alive to having 4 or 5 equipaments on display.  However, some of the Neutral roles are really hard - near impossible - to fulfill, and receiving one of them is almost a ""you lose"" situation. I wish there was always a way for a Neutral to win other than the normal one for the role - like being the one that kills the Hunter/Shadow with the highest HP or something more clever. But this isn't true, and takes away from the fun of the game as a whole, as I saw, several times, the players with the Neutrals having less than they should.  Still, is a good game, with easy decisions to be made and lots of interaction, from dumb one (you don't know who is who, but you still wants to hit someone) to the smart - but no brain burn. There is some memory aspect built into it - is important to remember who attacked who, and if this happened after a green card was given, and also remember the answer to the green cards you dealt, but isn't really hard to remember.  Shadow Hunters have less chaos than the one you will find in Mascarade or One Night Werewolf, since roles doesn't change.  Anyway, Shadow Hunters plays easy enough to be teach in a matter of minutes, and basically guarantees blind attacks, negotiation, lying, bluffing, threatening, backstabbing, or in other words: everything you want in a hidden role game!

114804,63888,8,"I like that each card is different and unique.  I can imagine that with more plays and knowledge of the deck there would be considerable groaning amongst the players that such and such a player got a particular card.  If I were to rank Innovation in a hierarchy with Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome, I would say that Race > Innovation > Glory to Rome.  Both Innovation and Glory to Rome are slower than Race for the Galaxy because there are so many things to consider.  The only time there are a ton of considerations to make in Race is when you've got a full hand of cards.  It can be time consuming to decide the implications of spending each one.  In Innovation, so far, I've found it to be rare to have a hand of more than four cards.  This means that the decisions you have to make come from what's already on the table rather than what is in your hand.  I prefer the decision tree of possible decisions (from the cards in your hand) rather than the decision of which power you've already got to activate.   I find the potential of cards in hand much more interesting.  Additionally, Innovation frequently causes players to have no cards in hand, so if the players have no powers that they'd like to use on the table, they can pretty much draw one and play one.  It leaves me with a feeling of simplicity.  My only decision is to figure out if the random card I've just drawn is good enough or should I just try for random luck again.  I'm someone who enjoys Fluxx, so I don't always mind this sort of mindless non-decision making.  That being said, the most experience player won every game that I've played so far, so I know the game is certainly more than dumb luck."
177926,172386,8.2,"[u]The Positive:[/u] (+) The art is not 'great', but it sure is very functional. It supports in understanding the game. Moreover, the components are of good quality (except an unfortunate misprint of some 1$-coins in which some are smaller than others)  (+) The game rules are very structured and limited. This elegant rule set makes the game easy to explain and understand.  (+) Notwithstanding the limited and easy rules make the game easily accessible, this game offers a huge amount of stuff to wrap your head around. Due to the intertwined mechanisms, there are often many ways to try to get things done, but they all require a very precise execution. The action system with the card piles effectivily forces players to rethink their strategies constantly as they have to split a winning combination of action cards after just one use. This makes that players are constantly planning many *many* turns ahead.  (+) The game feels really balanced as it will challenge each and every player no matter what path to victory they try to follow. I feel all important strategies to score many points are hard to pull off and even more so if they reap benefits along the way. This also means the game will keep all players down: no runaway leader problem here. [i]For example: You would like to aquire many shares of a company and pump up its value? Good idea! This strategy alone might score you about 100 points when executed really well and will earn you significant benefits along the way. All you need to do is -> First get lots of shares. You will need good-cards for that. Getting these cards requires other goods-cards you won't be able to use to buy the shares you want. So you will have to prioritize (unless of course you snatch away the right actionspot on the board with a worker in order to obtain extra shares without spending the good-cards in your action display, which you really should ;) ). If you overcame this problem, you are faced with the next one: Yay, you have interesting goods and you have built up your shares but... Now you need exploration cards in order to get those trading posts out! Good luck with that! Similar examples could be given for the game making life hard on players who try to get their bookkeeping track up, but when executed really well this path will also reward them in a variety of ways.[/i]  (+) Many different (very challenging!) paths to victory. Along the way, due to its intertwined mechanisms, the game will seduce you with really nice opportunities to stray from your path. Sometimes you should follow up on these, other times they should be avoided. It would take quite some insight into this game in order to assess correctly which is which.  (+) Thanks to the fact that all four companies come with 2 different sets of abilities and the order in which the companies can be placed around the game board, the game can get set up in many different ways, ensuring a high replayability.  (+) Due to the 'controlled' way the action card deck gets shuffled and put together, the game 'grows' in an interesting and correct way.   (+) Little to no luck dependence (only in distributing the starting tiles, in a minor extent (can be mitigated by clever placement) the drawing of book tiles and the order by which the action cards become available for sale (but this shouldn't lead to significant imbalances as the draw deck gets composed in a controlled way during set-up)).   (+) Player interaction sure is present. You prioritize your actions by assessing what the others will probably first go after. Doing so incorrectly could have serious consequences for your greater plan. Furthermore there is direct player interaction during exploration, increasing the value of a company while decreasing the value of others. This mainly happens in the second half of the game.  [u]The Negative:[/u] (-) This game really deceives first time players. Based on its cover, its name and learning the rules, when going in, most will think of this as a medium weight game. Soon they will realise they are in for a mind crushing experience in which one critical mistake in their planning (which must in detail span so many turns ahead!) might cost them *tons* of points. Although the rules are very accessible, the game in itself sure isn't. Know with whom you start this adventure!  (-) Downtime/Analysis Paralysis can be a big issue in Mombasa. As stated, this game is really hard. Many, many times, players will have to rethink about ways to get things done, and often they can only start doing so when the player going before them completed their action. Some players will say the game doesn't flow smoothly and can kind of drag.  (-) As much as I admire the fact that the game is balanced in a way which denies players to re-use winning combination of action cards, on the other hand, this can at times feel a little annoying. Another example: When after much hard work, you opened up an extra action slot, soon you realize you don't have enough cards to utilize all those slots and you realize that using extra slots will dilute your deck even more.  (-) 7 Rounds is so little. You get so few actions to get so many things done. In most games, I see this 'tightness' as an advantage, but in Mombasa, I get the feeling the game would have benefited from at least one extra round or so. The very limited amount of actions makes a rather unforgiving game even more unforgiving and it also means you can get very little use of the action cards you buy. Most will only get used once, twice or three times... On the other hand, the seven round in Mombasa give players just enough time to reach the end of the bookkeeping or diamond track and doing some crutial actions elsewhere on the gameboard. 7 Rounds is acceptable but (too?) tight.  [u]Conclusion:[/u] So, here you have it: A wolf in sheep's clothing. Mombasa, underneath its trite title and ordinary cover sleeps one monster of a game! If you're not in for some hard and sometimes unforgiving mind crunching work, you better let it sleep. However, if you and your gaming group are in for a serious challenge and are willing to commit a considerable amount of (waiting) time, Mombasa will reward you with some ingenious deck-splitting mechanisms, many good/bad opportunities for challenging paths to go after and a balanced gameplay in which you can be sure the game will give a delightfully/frustratingly (depening on your mood) hard time for everybody around the table, no exeptions!  [u]Tips:[/u] (*) The most straight-forward strategy is probably the diamond trail. Obtaining some diamond merchants will quickly boost your diamond score. However, this strategy will reap the least benefits along the way and the max of 60 points it delivers will be destinctly unsufficiant to win the game. It will complement other strategies, but won't get you to victory when your sole focus lies there (*) One of the harderst paths is the bookkeeping track, effectively melting your brain with impossible puzzles. However, you will get income along the way if you play your cards (books?) right and this strategy complements nicely with some other strategies (as doing it right means you will also have had to invest to a certain extent in goods and exploration actions). (*) I think it is quite impossible to do well on the share tracks of all 4 companies. I would advise against it, after all you will want at least one company to kick out of Africa when your massive exploration turn kicks into action! Better focus on one or two company tracks - and it better be the right ones! (try to build up a good stock of good cards which match the 'max'-bonus of the company you're going after). (*) Money, so easy to spend, but so hard to aquire... Use it thoughtfully and sparingly. (*) There are some main paths to scoring many points, but in my experience it is better to combine 2 of them, rather than focussing solely on one path or going for everything.

Adjacency of two areas is mostly unimportant. Your units enter the map regardless to where your other units are (but next to the king, which I don't get) .  2. Bidding for turn order. I find it so unnecessary, did all old euros had this? This might be part of calling El Grande dry (Khorne goes first because He Is The Blood God, now shutup!).  3. The action cards. You simply have to memorize as they don't have any obvious sense (theme wise) beside making the game replayable while making it all about short term tactics.  4. Kramer's action point system in a completely tactical game = downtime, downtime and AP.  Second game -------- Showed that knowing which cards are in the deck is truly important. Contraintuitivess matters less, but still, owning Chaos in the Old World I see no reason why I would play this if given the choice between the two.   I found Torres much better for somewhat similar style game (No turn order nonsense, cards are simpler and the spacial relations make much more sense making the whole thing is more intuitive to grasp)."

Everything is focused on the game mechanics, which are perfectly fine if not very original. You weigh-up the rolls needed to tackle a task, factor in any cards you possess that could influence your chances, consider whether the potential rewards are worth the potential penalties and then either go ahead or back down.

42985,40834,10,"See my comments on the base set. This feels less like an experiment in how the system works and more an attempt at making interesting cards to fit that system. My ideal setups are typically 3 cards from Intrigue which interact in different ways or lead down different paths, and then some simple utility cards from the base game to support those strategies."
125541,13,6,"Strategic and fun but frustrating if the dice aren't on your side.  Placement of first towns has too much weight over the rest of the game."
24903,42,8,"Elegant and abstract monster that plays relatively quickly"
77298,2993,7,"Useful expansion for additional players plus some additional rules which do not chnage the game too much and still add something nice. Recommended even for first time players."
111316,27588,5,"Zooleretto is a fairly typical more recent Spiel des Jahres. It offers somewhat limited choices within a family-compatible ruleset, and I can certainly understand why it's a big hit with younger gamers, what with all the cute animals."
181064,181304,7,"For me this ia a partygame. I only bring this game out when we have people over that are not really into boardgaming and on Halloween. Anyone can play it. It is fun but I would not recommend playing it with fewer then four player. It shines at higher player counts. The more experienced the ghost is, the better the game flows but one person shouldn't be allowed to hog this position.  With Hidden Signs expansion."
101228,121408,8,"Takes the strong foundation of Dominion and adds another layer of depth/interaction with the board. I like the additional scoring options that this contains over Dominion. It makes it feel more involved and dynamic. "
106178,176396,6,"I like this game quite a bit, but you need to play the version with the tower blocks and the expert board for a proper experience, in my opinion."
95846,34119,6,"Prepare for the length of the game.  It usually takes us a few hours, but we laugh a lot and take breaks.  Nothing like kicking back with some beer, some good friends, and long, hilarous tales to tell."
169257,13308,3,"03/29/05 Played once. Seemed almost the same as Montgolfiere (which I didn't like), only nicer bits. I'd save this one for the kids. Of little interest to this adult."
108036,3201,8,"I love this so far, but nobody will play it with me!  The claustrophobic board and forced forward-momentum render claims that this is little more than Stratego utterly misplaced. If Stratego was so hemmed-in and relentless it would probably be on my wishlist.  There's an extraordinarily strong sense of tension and variety for such a short game. The thematic elements are solid, and the two sides feel genuinely different to play.  One of the few games which invariably begins with me thinking ""How on [i]earth[/i] am I going to win this one?"" Delicious.  This rating is likely to rise in future, assuming I can wangle any further play."
5383,173,5,"[1 play] I was surprised by how mediocre and tedious I found this. I just can't see why anyone inhabiting a universe where Circus Maximus exists would ever bother playing this game.   In terms of player interaction, Formula Dé falls between Rallyman and Circus Maximus.  FD has none of the deliberate interference/attacking of CM, but blocking and maneuvering is much more important than it is in Rallyman where you're spaced out and judged by time, not position. This game made me appreciate Rallyman (which I'm also lukewarm toward) a little more. "
132930,6249,7.5,"We play this game quite a bit because its design is somewhat elegant. It is easy for non-gamers to understand yet it has plenty of subtle strategies."
77097,20551,3,"I did not find this game fun at all. Too much planning for too many random things."

28958,2952,1,"Boy do I hate trivia games.  They are unfair because no one knows those random facts."
123320,3076,10,"Such a great game.  Including the expansion buildings keeps this fresh."
14857,1294,6,"It's a ""6"" and not a ""5"" imho because it was my first mystery solving game (introduced the idea) "
154311,27173,6.5,"Played only with the standard rules.   I enjoyed this one, but it began to feel too dependent on the luck of the draw after I got more experienced with it. Also, works less well when scaled to higher player counts.   I'd be willing to play again, but no reason to seek it out."
156014,1406,6,"Used to be favourite game, but now I'd only play it if for some reason EVERYONE else didn't want to play any of the other really good games available."
177032,1198,5,"Not really a board game though."
37567,63628,3,"It is a really cool concept.  Unfortunately, this doesn't feel developed, not surprising from a Kickstarter project.  It suffers from a massive run-away leader problem, it effectively eliminates players and leaves them with little to do, it expects players to debilitate their defenses by trying to stop a runaway leader, and the deck large and is shuffled together entirely so outside of the set there is nothing remotely close to a planned dispersion of card types with no way to prevent clumping of essential cards.    Three players really doesn't work, as the runaway leader can flood the guy to his right, so that they have to clear their board to do anything giving the workers back to the leader again.  This forces the other player to insure that they can get the espionage, which is not always possible, especially with the player to his right always reassembling.  Worse than that is that one player is expected to take the hit in efficiency in order to pound on the leader while the other player can just glide by without having to be responsible for it.    Plus, pounding the leader games tend to suck, but at least most of them are in fillers that end in 20 minutes.  This takes hours.  On top of all that, it really is yet another worker placement euro, with nothing particularly special about it other than the theme.  If it were the case where the game was tight that might be enough, but everything is so half baked here.  ******THIS GOT THE BONE*******"

17788,12,7.11,"I really liked the unique bidding found in this game. The theme and components are nice and are greatly enhanced by having a player aid found in the files section of BGG. I am eager to play again. Would love to have it in my colleciton."
1248,822,10,"Easy to learn and play, great for young players as well.  I've yet to teach a person to play who hasn't enjoyed the game."
30089,320,7,"The best word game ever created"
35483,102652,8,"Super simple rules with a great summary. Fantastic value for what you get in the box. This game feels like you are building a new comic book adventure to be inside every time you play."
119795,9209,6,"Most of my friends enjoy this one more than I do. Perhaps I haven't caught on to the competitive aspect of the game yet, but it seems we mostly focus entirely on our own tickets and ignore everyone else unless there is obvious overlap threatening, in which case it's just the first person to randomly draw enough cards (which does lead to some tense moments at least). Not a wide enough variety of meaningful choices on one's turn, IMO."

58083,92828,7.22,"4-12 Best with 6 Absolutely no strategy required! It's one of those game that you don't care much about winning but it can become quite frustrating if you're losing. I enjoy it once in a while although I only play it with kids, older people and non-gamers."
94174,3201,7,"Replaced by the ""The Luxe Version""."
170375,41,8,"Takes 2 minutes to teach.  It is a simple probability game.  The true appeal of the game is the gambling.  You can tiptoe each turn or take risk to win sooner.  A hit with anyone I have introduced it to."

37301,25821,9,"This or any game of the Mafia/Werewolf-family is THE party game or game for bigger (I'd say 8+) groups of people. I introduced this to my kids at school (a democratic school) and they totally loved to play this for years... wherever possible. Can be played with self-made cards/tokens or a simple deck of playing cards. But this edition is very beautiful and adds some nice atmosphere."

59277,8203,7.5,"A very solid, strategic abstract game for all ages. I really enjoy playing this to pass the time, or between other games.  The only drawback I can find to this game is that the hexes tend to slide apart if you are grabbing some of the center ones. However, this isn't a major issue and can easily be worked around.  Don't let these cute penguins fool you. They are jerks."
136082,92828,8,"Works surprisingly well with 7+ players, but I am not a huge fan of the 3-player variant"
95576,13,7,"An all time classic. A bit too luck-dependent though, but that can be compensated by using the event cards (which I highly recommend)."

47438,129622,8,"16 cards in a bag should not be this much fun."
116256,54043,9,"One of my favorite two player games.  Simple choices, but still good strategy.  The portability and excellent, colorful components are a big plus for me too.  Makes me wish I had the chance to play two-player games more often."
20323,11,6,"It's humorous artwork somewhat masks the interesting strategies that go into this game. Fun and easy to learn (and to travel with, once you know the rules). Plays very well with casual gamers and more serious ones as well."
145331,40692,7,"Definitely up for more games of this, though it feels as though it might at best drift up to my invisible ceiling for light games (7.5) and flatten itself out there.  Update: as has been proclaimed here, the two player game is really quite good and not the shallow end of the pool at all.  Good stuff."
86287,66362,8,"This is a very solid, quick playing tile laying game. Really like the tiles in a rondel mechanic. Can be some pretty tough decisions on skipping ahead to get some of the bonus cards. Probably would be enhanced nicely if the cubes were replaced with wood tokens shaped like the things they represent. This will likely become a game that I play for a long time in the future."
129783,3955,10,"As far as card games go, this is the one most enjoyed by our group, from three players and up. Quick, fast and interactive, we've never had a dull game and this is one game that everyone can agree upon and is always eager to play."

165589,40692,7,"My first venture into the hobby and boy, am I glad I did. A close friend didn't like the simple, repetitive dice rolling of Risk and wanted something new. Picked this up on an Amazon sale and haven't looked back. It's fantasy theme was an instant hit and it's replay value is super high."
824,158899,7.5,"One of the best ""family style"" games out there. I love the programmed movement, and the ""trying to keep my deck clean""; but most of all, I love the punching, shooting and running. The theme is also amazing."
