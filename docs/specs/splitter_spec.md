### 1.1 Document Overview

The document classifier contains the following primary classes, and their relationships:

+ **Document** – This is the base class for the representation of a stored document. The constructor for the class object takes as parameters the stored path to the document, optionally a directory path for storing extracted pages and text, and optionally an event completion handler when processing the document asynchronously, and optionally a config parameter for configuring the NLP preprocessing.

```python
document = Document(“/somedir/mydocument.pdf”, “/mypages/mydocument”)
```

The constructors calls the `_exists()` and `_collate()` private methods for the specified document.

+ **Page** – This is a base class for the representation of an extracted page from the document. The `Document` class contains a list (index) of the extracted pages as `Page` objects.

### 1.2 Initializer (Constructor)

**Synopsis**

```python
Document( document=None, dir=’./’, ehandler=None,  config=None)
```

**Parameters**

**document:** If not None, a string that is either:

    1. local path to document  
    2. remote path to document ((i.e., http[s]://…)
    The document must be one of the following types: PDF, JPG (JPEG, J2K), PNG, BMP or TIF (TIFF)

**dir:** The directory where to store the machine learning ready data.

**ehandler:** If not None, the processing of the images into machine learning ready data will be asynchronous, and the value of the parameter is the function (or method) that is the event handler when processing is complete.

The event handler takes the form:

```python
def myHandler(images): 
    # where images is the Images object that was preprocessed.
```

**config:** If not None, a list of one or more configuration settings as strings:

    bare
    pos
    roman
    segment
    stem=gap|porter|Lancaster|snowball|lemma

**Usage**

When specified with no parameters, an empty `Document` object is created. The `Document` object may then be used to subsequent load (retrieve) previously stored preprocessed machine learning ready data (see `load()`).

Otherwise, the document parameter must be specified.

The document specified by the document parameter will be preprocessed according to the optional parameters and configuration settings.

By default, the document will be preprocessed as follows:

1.	The document will be split into individual pages.
2.	A `Page` object will be created for each page.
3.	If the document (or page) is an image (e.g., scanned PDF), it will be OCR’d.
4.	The digital text will be extracted from each page and stored in the `Page` object.
5.	The text will be optionally segmented into regions if the configuration setting segment is specified.
6.	The text from each page object will be preprocessed into machine learning ready data (see [**syntax**](syntax_spec.md) module specification), according to the optional parameters and configuration settings.
7.	If the document was a scanned or image document, the quality of the scan will be estimated, unless `Document.SCANCHECK` is set to zero.

The machine learning ready data will be stored on a per page basis in the directory specified by the parameter `dir`.

The following files are created and stored:

    <document><pageno>.<suffix>
    <document><pageno>.txt
    <document>.<pageno>.json

The `<document>` is the root name of the document, and `<pageno>` is the corresponding page number starting at page 1. The file ending in the original file suffix `<suffix>` is the split page. The file ending in the file suffix `.txt` is the extracted text. The file ending in the file suffix `.json` is the NLP preprocessed machine learning data stored in a JSON format.

If the ehandler parameter is not `None`, then the above will occur asynchronously, and when completed, the corresponding event handler will be called with the `Document` object passed as a parameter.

If the path to the document file is remote (i.e., starts with http), an HTTP request will be made to fetch the contents of the file from the remote location.

**Exceptions**

A `TypeError` is raised if the type of the parameter is not the expected type.  
A `AttributeError` is raised if an invalid configuration setting is specified.  
A `FileNotFoundError` is raised if the document file does not exist.  
A `IOError` is raised if an error occurs reading in the document file.

#### 1.5.1 load()

**Synopsis**

```python

```

**Parameters**

**name:** The name of the document. 

**Usage**

This method will load into memory a preprocessed machine learning ready data from the corresponding JSON files specified by the document (root) name. The method will load the JSON files by the filename `<name><pageno>.json`. If `dir` is `None`, then it will look for the files where the current value for `dir` is defined (either locally or reset by the dir property). Otherwise, it will look for the files under the directory specified by the `dir` parameter.

Once loaded, the `Document` object will have the same characteristics as when the `Document` object was created.

**Exceptions**

A `TypeError` is raised if the type of the parameter is not the expected type.  
A `ValueError` is raised if the name parameter is `None`.

### 1.6 Document Private Methods

The `Document` class contains the following private methods:

+ `_exists()` – This method checks if the document exists at the specified stored path. If not, a `FileNotFound` exception is thrown.
<br/><br/>
+ `_collate()` – This method performs the collation task, which includes:
<br/><br/>
   - Determines the number of pages in the document.
<br/><br/>
   - Splits the document into individual pages, where each page is individually stored in the same format as the document. The pages are named as follows:
<br/><br/>
       `<name><pageno>.<suffix>`
   
       Each page is stored in the subdirectory specified by the property dir. If `dir` is `None`, then the page is stored in the same directory where program is ran; otherwise, if the subdirectory does not exist, it is created.

    - If the page is a scanned PDF page, the scanned image is extracted and saved as a PNG image. The PNG image is then OCR’d to convert to text.
    
       `<name><pageno>.png`
   
    - If the page is a TIFF facsimile, the TIFF image is then OCR’d to convert to text.
    
       `<name><pageno>.tif`
   
    - If the page is an image capture (e.g. camera capture), the captured image (e.g., JPG) is then OCR’d to convert to text.
    
       `<name><pageno>.jpg`

    - Extracts the raw text from the page , where each page is individually stored in a raw text format. The pages are named as follows:
    
       `<name><pageno>.txt`
   
       Each page is stored in the subdirectory specified by the property `dir`. If `dir` is `None`, then the page is stored in the same directory where program is ran.
   
    - Create a `Page` object for each page and adds them to the pages index property.
    
    - If the document format is raw text, then:
        * Treats as a single page.  
        * Stores only a single page text file.
<br/><br/>
    - If the document format is PDF, then page splitting and extraction of the raw text per page is done with the open source version of Ghostscript. If the document is a scanned PDF, the image is extracted and converted to PNG using Ghostscript and then OCR’d using open source Tesseract.
<br/><br/>
   - If the document format is TIFF, then page splitting is done with the open source Magick and then OCR’d using open source Tesseract.
<br/><br/>
+ `_langcheck()` – This method is called after NLP preprocessing of the document has been completed. The method will sample upto twenty words to probabilistically determine the language of the document. The detected languages are English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.
<br/><br/>
+ `_scancheck()` – This method is called after NLP preprocessing of the document has been completed, and the document was a scanned image. The method will sample upto `SCANCHECK` number of words for recognition in the detected language dictionary (i.e., English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish). The method will check the words on either page 1 or page 2, depending on which page has a greater number of words. Punctuation, symbols, acronyms or single letter words are excluded. The method then sets the internal variable `_quality` to the percentage of the words that were recognized (between 0 and 1).
<br/><br/>
+ `_async()` – This method performs asynchronous processing of the `_collate()` function, when the optional ehandler parameter to the constructor is not `None`. When processing is completed, the `ehandler` parameter value is called as a function to signal completion of the processing, and the `Document` object is passed as a parameter.
