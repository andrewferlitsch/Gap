                  Important Notice from the Foreign Service Benefit Plan About
                     Our Prescription Drug Coverage and Medicare
      The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has determined that the Foreign Service Benefit Plan’s (FSBP) prescription 
      drug coverage is, on average, expected to pay out as much as the standard Medicare prescription drug coverage will pay for 
      all Plan participants and is considered Creditable Coverage.  This means you do not need to enroll in Medicare Part D and 
      pay extra for prescription drug coverage.  If you decide to enroll in Medicare Part D later, you will not have to pay a penalty 
      for late enrollment as long as you keep your FEHB coverage. 
      However, if you choose to enroll in Medicare Part D, you can keep your FEHB coverage and the Foreign Service Benefit 
      Plan will coordinate benefits with Medicare. 
      Remember:  If you are an annuitant and you cancel your FEHB coverage, you may not re-enroll in the FEHB Program. 
                            Please be advised
      If you lose or drop your FEHB coverage and go 63 days or longer without prescription drug coverage that’s at least as good 
      as Medicare’s prescription drug coverage, your monthly Medicare Part D premium will go up at least 1% per month for every 
      month that you did not have that coverage.  For example, if you go 19 months without Medicare Part D prescription drug 
      coverage, your premium will always be at least 19 percent higher than what many other people pay.  You will have to pay 
      this higher premium as long as you have Medicare prescription drug coverage.  In addition, you may have to wait until the 
      next Annual Coordinated Election Period (October 15 through December 7) to enroll in Medicare Part D. 
                        Medicare’s Low Income Benefits
      For people with limited income and resources, extra help paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available.

      This brochure is the official statement of benefits.  No verbal statement can modify or otherwise affect the benefits, 
      limitations, and exclusions of this brochure.  It is your responsibility to be informed about your health benefits. 
      If you are enrolled in this Plan, you are entitled to the benefits described in this brochure. If you are enrolled in Self and 
      Family coverage, each eligible family member is also entitled to these benefits. If you are enrolled in Self Plus One 
      coverage, you and one eligible family member that you designate when you enroll are entitled to these benefits. You do not 
      have a right to benefits that were available before January 1, 2018, unless those benefits are also shown in this brochure.  
      OPM negotiates benefits and rates with each plan annually.  Benefit changes are effective January 1, 2018, and changes are 
      summarized on pages 15-16.  Rates are shown on the back cover of this brochure. 
      Coverage under this plan qualifies as minimum essential coverage (MEC) and satisfies the Patient Protection and 
      Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) individual shared responsibility requirement. Please visit the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
      website at www.irs.gov/uac/Questions-and-Answers-on-the-Individual-Shared-Responsibility-Provision for more 
      information on the individual requirement for MEC. 
      The ACA establishes a minimum value for the standard of benefits of a health plan. The minimum value standard is 60% 
      (actuarial value). The health coverage of this plan does meet the minimum value standard for the benefits the plan provides. 
      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 3 Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory 
                           Plain Language 
      All FEHB brochures are written in plain language to make them easy to understand. Here are some examples: 
       Except for necessary technical terms, we use common words. For instance, “you” means the enrollee or family member, 
       “we” means the Foreign Service Benefit Plan.  
       We limit acronyms to ones you know. FEHB is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. OPM is the United 
       States Office of Personnel Management. If we use others, we tell you what they mean.  
       Our brochure and other FEHB plans’ brochures have the same format and similar descriptions to help you compare 
       plans. 
                        Stop Health Care Fraud! 
      Fraud increases the cost of health care for everyone and increases your Federal Employees Health Benefits Program 
      premium. 
      OPM’s Office of the Inspector General investigates all allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse in the FEHB Program 
      regardless of the agency that employs you or from which you retired. 
      Protect Yourself From Fraud – Here are some things that you can do to prevent fraud: 
       Do not give your Plan identification (ID) number over the telephone or to people you do not know, except for your 
       health care provider, authorized health benefits Plan or OPM representative. 
       Let only the appropriate medical professionals review your medical record or recommend services. 
       Avoid using health care providers who say that an item or service is not usually covered, but they know how to bill us to 
       get it paid. 
       Carefully review explanations of benefits (EOBs) statements that you receive from us. 
       Periodically review your claim history for accuracy to ensure we have not been billed for services that you did not 
       receive. 
       Do not ask your doctor to make false entries on certificates, bills or records in order to get us to pay for an item or 
       service. 
       If you suspect that a provider has charged you for services you did not receive, billed you twice for the same service, or 
       misrepresented any information, do the following: 
      - Call the provider and ask for an explanation. There may be an error. 
      - If the provider does not resolve the matter, call us at 202-833-4910 and explain the situation. 
      - If we do not resolve the issue: 
                    CALL --THE HEALTH CARE FRAUD HOTLINE
                             877-499-7295
         OR go to www.opm.gov/our-inspector-general/hotline-to-report-fraud-waste-or-abuse/complaint-form/
        The online reporting form is the desired method of reporting fraud in order to ensure accuracy, and a quicker 
                            response time.

      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 4 Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory 
       Do not maintain as a family member on your policy: 
      - Your former spouse after a divorce decree or annulment is final (even if a court order stipulates otherwise); or 
      - Your child age 26 or over (unless he/she was disabled and incapable of self-support prior to age 26). 
       If you have any questions about the eligibility of a dependent, check with your personnel office if you are employed, 
       with your retirement office (such as OPM) if you are retired, or with the National Finance Center if you are enrolled 
       under Temporary Continuation of Coverage (TCC). 
       Fraud or intentional misrepresentation of material fact is prohibited under the Plan. You can be prosecuted for fraud and 
       your agency may take action against you. Examples of fraud include falsifying a claim to obtain FEHB benefits, trying to 
       or obtaining service or coverage for yourself or someone who is not eligible for coverage, or enrolling in the Plan when 
       you are no longer eligible. 
       If your enrollment continues after you are no longer eligible for coverage (i.e., you have separated from Federal service) 
       and premiums are not paid, you will be responsible for all benefits paid during the period in which premiums were not 
       paid. You may be billed by your provider for services received. You may be prosecuted for fraud for knowingly using 
       health insurance benefits for which you have not paid premiums. It is your responsibility to know when you or a family 
       member is no longer eligible to use your health insurance coverage. 
                     Discrimination is Against the Law 
      The Foreign Service Benefit Plan complies with all applicable Federal civil rights laws, to include both Title VII of the 
      Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act.  Pursuant to Section 1557 the Foreign Service 
      Benefit Plan does not discriminate, exclude people, or treat them differently on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, 
      disability, or sex. 
          Preventing Medical Mistakes and Member Rights and Responsibilities 
      Medical mistakes continue to be a significant cause of preventable deaths within the United States. While death is the most 
      tragic outcome, medical mistakes cause other problems such as permanent disabilities, extended hospital stays, longer 
      recoveries, and even additional treatments. Medical mistakes and their consequences also add significantly to the overall 
      cost of health care.  Hospitals and health care providers are being held accountable for the quality of care and reduction in 
      medical mistakes by their accrediting bodies.  You can also improve the quality and safety of your own health care and that 
      of your family members by learning more about and understanding your risks.  Your provider has the responsibility to 
      provide you with complete information concerning your diagnosis, evaluation, treatment and prognosis. Additionally, 
      providers should allow your participation in decisions involving your health care. Take these simple steps: 
      1. Ask questions if you have doubts or concerns.
       Ask questions and make sure you understand the answers. 
       Choose a doctor with whom you feel comfortable talking. 
       Take a relative or friend with you to help you take notes, ask questions and understand answers. 
       Provide complete and accurate information to the best of your ability. 
       Inform the provider about any living will, medical power of attorney or other directive that could affect care. 
       Treat all health care providers respectfully. 
       Follow the treatment plan prescribed by your health care provider. 
      2. Keep and bring a list of all the medicines you take.
       Bring the actual medicines or give your doctor and pharmacist a list of all the medicines and dosage that you take, 
       including non-prescription (over-the-counter) medicines and nutritional supplements. 
      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 5 Introduction/Plain Language/Advisory 
       Tell your doctor and pharmacist about any drug, food, and other allergies you have, such as latex. 
       Ask about any risks or side effects of the medication and what to avoid while taking it.  Be sure to write down what your 
       doctor or pharmacist says. 
       Make sure your medicine is what the doctor ordered.  Ask the pharmacist about your medicine if it looks different than 
       you expected. 
       Read the label and patient package insert when you get your medicine, including all warnings and instructions. 
       Know how to use your medicine. Especially note the times and conditions when your medicine should and should not be 
       taken. 
       Contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. 
       Understand both the generic and brand names of your medication.  This helps ensure you do not receive double dosing 
       from taking both a generic and a brand. It also helps prevent you from taking a medication to which you are allergic. 
      3. Get the results of any test or procedure.
       Ask when and how you will get the results of tests or procedures. Will it be in person, by phone, mail, or through the 
       Provider's portal? 
       Don’t assume the results are fine if you do not get them when expected. Contact your health care provider and ask for 
       your results.  
       Ask what the results mean for your care. 
      4. Talk to your doctor about which hospital or clinic is best for your health needs.

      Preventable Health Care Acquired Conditions ("Never Events")
      When you enter the hospital for treatment of one medical problem, you don’t expect to leave with additional injuries, 
      infections, or other serious conditions that occur during the course of your stay. Although some of these complications may 
      not be avoidable, patients do suffer from injuries or illnesses that could have been prevented if doctors or the hospital had 
      taken proper precautions. Errors in medical care that are clearly identifiable, preventable and serious in their consequences 
      for patients, can indicate a significant problem in the safety and credibility of a health care facility.  These conditions and 
      errors are sometimes called “Never Events” or “Serious Reportable Events.” 
      We have a benefit payment policy that encourages hospitals to reduce the likelihood of hospital-acquired conditions such as 
      certain infections, severe bedsores, and fractures, and to reduce medical errors that should never happen. When such an 
      event occurs, neither you nor your FEHB plan will incur costs to correct the medical error. 
      You will not be billed for inpatient services related to treatment of specific hospital acquired conditions or for inpatient 
      services needed to correct Never Events, if you use Foreign Service Benefit Plan in-network providers. This policy helps 
      to protect you from preventable medical errors and improve the quality of care you receive.

                  eligible family member. When you change to Self Plus One or Self and Family because you 
                  marry, the change is effective on the first day of the pay period that begins after your employing 
                  office receives your enrollment form. Benefits will not be available to your spouse until you are

      General features of our High Option
      We have network providers: 
      Our network providers offer services through our fee-for-service Plan. The Plan uses the Aetna Choice POS II (Open 
      Access) Product as its network. This means that certain hospitals and other health care providers are in-network. When you 
      use an in-network provider, generally you will receive covered services at reduced cost. We encourage you to establish a 
      primary care provider to assist in coordinating your medical care in the safest and most cost effective manner. Aetna is 
      solely responsible for the selection of in-network providers in your area. Contact us for names of in-network providers and 
      to verify their continued participation. Access our network directory as a link through our website 
                                              www.AFSPA.org/FSBP  
      or call 202-833-4910 (M-F 8:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. ET) for additional information. In addition, you can reach our website 
      through the FEHB website, www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/. 
      Aetna Choice POS II (Open Access) identifies high performing in-network physicians and physician groups in twelve 
      medical specialty areas with an Aexcel designation. See Section 5(h), Aexcel Designated Providers for additional 
      information. 
      The out-of-network benefits are the standard benefits of this Plan.  In-network benefits apply only when you use an in-
      network provider.  Provider networks may be more extensive in some areas than others.  In-network benefit levels also 
      apply to providers outside the 50 United States.  We cannot guarantee the availability of every specialty in all areas.  We 
      cannot guarantee the continued participation of any specific provider.  In the network, if no network provider is available or 
      you do not use a network provider, the standard out-of-network benefits apply.  When you use a network facility, keep in 
      mind that the health care professionals who provide services to you in the facility may not be in-network providers in our 
      network. We will pay up to the Plan allowance at the in-network provider percentage for services you receive from out-of-
      network anesthesiologists (including Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists), radiologists, pathologists, emergency room 
      physicians, hospitalists, intensivists and neonatologists. This provision also applies when an out-of-network surgeon’s 
      immediate or emergency care is required. You will be responsible to pay the in-network coinsurance and any difference 
      between the Plan allowance and billed amount for these out-of-network providers. When non-emergency care by out-of-
      network surgeons is provided, regular out-of-network benefits apply.   
      Follow these procedures when you use an in-network provider in order to receive in-network benefits:
       Verify that the provider is in the network when you make your appointment. Confirm that the address for your 
       appointment is the same location as on our website.  Providers may choose to be an in-network provider at one 
       location but not at another;
      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 12           Section 1 
       Present your Foreign Service Benefit Plan Identification (ID) Card at the time you visit your health care provider, 
       confirming network participation in order to receive in-network benefits and the provider’s continued 
       participation in our network.  If you do not present your ID Card, the provider may not give you the in-network 
       discount; and
       Generally, you do not pay an in-network provider at the time of service.  In-network providers must bill us 
       directly.  We must reimburse the provider directly.  In-network providers will bill you for any balance after our 
       payment to them.
      Consider in-network cost savings when you review Plan benefits.  Check with the Plan to find out which local facilities and 
      providers are in-network providers.  Also, check with your physician to see if he or she has admitting privileges at an in-
      network hospital. 
      Other out-of-network participating providers:
      This Plan offers you access to other out-of-network participating health care providers that have agreed to discount their 
      charges. Covered services provided by these other-out-of network participating providers are considered at the negotiated 
      rate subject to applicable deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.  Since these other out-of-network participating 
      providers are not considered in-network providers, out-of-network benefit levels will apply.  Contact us at 202-833-4910 
      for more information about these other out-of-network participating providers. 
      How we pay providers
      We generally reimburse our in-network providers based on an agreed-upon fee schedule.  We do not offer them additional 
      financial incentives based on care provided or not provided to you.  Our standard provider agreements do not contain any 
      contractual provisions that include incentives to restrict the providers’ ability to communicate with and advise you of any 
      appropriate treatment options.  Also, we have no compensation, ownership or other influential interests that are likely to 
      affect provider advice or treatment decisions. 
      We may, through a negotiated arrangement with some health care providers, apply a discount to covered services that you 
      receive from any such health care provider.  To locate a provider from whom a discount may be available, call the number 
      on your Identification Card. 
      For providers in the 50 United States (including the District of Columbia and also Guam), whether you use an in-network 
      or an out-of-network provider, generally we will pay the provider directly unless payment is noted on the bill we receive.  
      If you have made payment to the provider, please advise us when you submit your claim. 
      We use National Standardized Criteria Sets and other nationally recognized clinical guidelines and resources in making 
      determinations regarding inpatient hospital, acute rehabilitation, residential treatment precertification, and also skilled 
      nursing facility stays, extended stay reviews, observation stay reviews, and reviews of procedures and therapies that require 
      preauthorization (see Section 3, You need prior Plan approval for certain services). These determinations can affect how we 
      provide benefits. 
      We apply the American Medical Association’s (AMA) and/or Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) correct 
      coding in reviewing billed services and making Plan benefit payments for them. There are exceptions based on benefits, 
      published Medical Policies and when a provider's contract with our network or other participating provider contract 
      stipulates otherwise. 
      For providers outside the United States, except for providers in our International Hospital Direct Billing Arrangement (see 
      Section 7, Overseas claims), generally we will pay you.

        Section 5, Benefits. Also, we edited and clarified language throughout the brochure; any language change not shown 
        here is a clarification that does not change benefits.

      Where you get covered You can get care from any “covered provider” or “covered facility.”  We do not require referrals 
      care       to see a specialist. How much we pay – and you pay – depends on the type of covered provider 
                 or facility you use.  If you use our in-network providers, you will pay less. 
        Covered providersWe provide benefits for the services of covered professional providers, as required by Section 
                 2706(a) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Coverage of practitioners is not determined by 
                 your state’s designation as a medically underserved area (MUA). 
                 Covered professional providers are medical practitioners who perform covered services when 
                 acting within the scope of their license or certification under applicable state law and who 
                 furnish, bill, or are paid for their health care services in the normal course of business. Covered 
                 services must be provided in the state in which the practitioner is licensed or certified. 
        Covered facilitiesCovered facilities include: 
                    Birthing Center — A licensed facility that is equipped and operated solely to provide

                   residential evaluation, treatment and comprehensive specialized services relating to the 
                   individual’s medical, physical, mental health, and/or substance misuse disorder therapy 
                   needs. RTCs offer programs for persons who need short-term transitional services designed 
                   to achieve predicted outcomes focused on fostering improvement or stability in functional, 
                   physical and/or mental health, recognizing the individuality, strengths, and needs of the 
                   persons served.  
                    Skilled Nursing Facility — An institution or that part of an institution, which provides 
                   convalescent skilled nursing care 24-hours-a-day and is classified as a skilled nursing facility

                    Urgent Care Center — A free-standing ambulatory care center, outside of a hospital 
                   emergency department, that provides emergency treatment for medical conditions that are 
                   not life-threatening, but need prompt attention, on a walk-in basis. 
        Transitional careSpecialty care: If you have a chronic or disabling condition and 
                    lose access to your specialist because we drop out of the Federal Employees Health Benefits 
                   (FEHB) Program and you enroll in another FEHB Plan, or 
                    lose access to your in-network specialist because we terminate our contract with your 
                   specialist for reasons other than for cause, 
                 you may be able to continue seeing your specialist and receiving any in-network benefits for up 
                 to 90 days after you receive notice of the change. Contact us or, if we drop out of the Program, 
                 contact your new plan. 
                 If you are in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and you lose access to your specialist 
                 based on the above circumstances, you can continue to see your specialist and your in-network 
                 benefits continue until the end of your postpartum care, even if it is beyond the 90 days. 
        If you are We pay for covered services from the effective date of your enrollment.  However, if you are in 
       hospitalized when the hospital when your enrollment in our Plan begins, call our customer service department 
       your enrollment immediately at 202-833-4910.  If you are new to the FEHB Program, we will reimburse you for 
       begins    your covered services while you are in the hospital beginning on the effective date of your 
                 coverage. 
                 If you changed from another FEHB plan to us, your former plan will pay for the hospital stay 
                 until: 
                    you are discharged, not merely moved to an alternative care center; 
                    the day your benefits from your former plan run out; or 
                    the 92nd day after you become a member of this Plan, whichever happens first. 
                 These provisions apply only to the benefits of the hospitalized person.  If your plan terminates 
                 participation in the FEHB in whole or in part, or if OPM orders an enrollment change, this 
                 continuation of coverage provision does not apply.  In such cases, the hospitalized family 
                 member’s benefits under the new plan begin on the effective date of enrollment. 
     2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 18            Section 3 
      You need prior Plan The pre-service claim approval processes for inpatient hospital admissions (called 
      approval for certain precertification) and for other services, are detailed in this Section.  A pre-service claim is any 
      services   claim, in whole or in part, that requires approval from us in advance of obtaining medical care or 
                 services.  In other words, a pre-service claim for benefits (1) requires precertification, prior 
                 approval or a referral and (2) will result in a reduction of benefits if you do not obtain 
                 precertification, prior approval or a referral. 
                 You must get prior approval for certain services. Failure to do so may result in a $500 penalty to 
                 be taken from any inpatient or Skilled Nursing Facility benefits provided by the Plan. Please see 
                 Warning below. In addition, we may deny benefits for services listed in this Section, under Other 
                 services. 
        Inpatient hospital Precertification is the process by which – prior to your inpatient hospital or Skilled Nursing 
       and skilled nursing Facility admission – we evaluate the medical necessity or to confirm coverage of your proposed 
       facility admissionsstay and the number of days required to treat your condition. Unless we are misled by the 
                 information given to us, we won’t change our decision on medical necessity. 
               Warning:Your in-network physician, hospital, or skilled nursing facility will take care of requesting 
                 precertification. You should always ask your physician, hospital, or skilled nursing facility 
                 whether they have contacted us for precertification. For out-of-network hospitals and Skilled 
                 Nursing Facility admissions, we will reduce our benefits for the out-of-network inpatient 
                 hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility stay by $500 if no one contacts us for precertification (see 
                 page 60). If the stay is not medically necessary, we will only pay for any covered medical 
                 services and supplies that are otherwise payable on an outpatient basis. 
               Exceptions:You do not need precertification in these cases: 
                    You are admitted to a hospital, Skilled Nursing Facility or residential treatment center 
                   outside the 50 United States.  However, the Plan will review all services to establish medical 
                   necessity or to confirm coverage.  We may request medical records in order to determine 
                   medical necessity. 
                    You have another group health insurance policy that is the primary payor for the hospital 
                   stay. 
                    Medicare Part A is the primary payor for the hospital stay.  Note:  If you exhaust your 
                   Medicare hospital benefits and do not want to use your Medicare lifetime reserve days or you 
                   have no Medicare lifetime reserve days left, then we will become the primary payor and you 
                   must precertify. 
        Other servicesWhen you see an in-network physician, that physician must obtain precertification or prior 
                 approval for certain services such as inpatient hospitalization and the following services. If you

                 hours after a cesarean section, then your physician or the hospital must contact us for 
                 precertification of additional days. Further, if your baby stays after you are discharged, then your 
                 physician or the hospital must contact us for precertification of additional days for your baby. 
                 Note: When a newborn requires definitive treatment after the mother’s confinement, the newborn 
                 is considered a patient in his or her own right. If the newborn is eligible for coverage, regular 
                 medical or surgical benefits apply rather than maternity benefits.

                     stay. 
                   We do not reimburse you for copayments. 
                   Note:  If the billed amount or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have 
                   agreed to accept as payment in full is less than your copayment, you pay the lower 
                   amount. 
      Deductible   A deductible is a fixed amount of covered expenses you must incur for certain covered 
                   services and supplies before we start paying benefits for them.  We do not reimburse you 
                   for the deductible. Benefits paid by us do not count towards the deductible.  Copayments 
                   and coinsurance amounts do not count toward any deductible.  When a covered service or 
                   supply is subject to a deductible, only the Plan allowance for the service or supply counts 
                   toward the deductible. Expenses are “incurred” on the date on which the service or supply 
                   is received. 
                   The calendar year deductible is $300 per person for in-network providers (including 
                   Guam) and providers outside the 50 United States or $400 per person for out-of-network 
                   providers (including Guam). Any expenses incurred that apply toward deductibles for in-
                   network or out-of-network apply toward both in and out-of-network limits. 
                   Under a Self Only enrollment, the deductible is considered satisfied and benefits are 
                   payable for you when your covered expenses applied to the calendar year deductible for 
                   your enrollment reach $300 for in-network providers (including Guam) and providers 
                   outside the 50 United States or $400 for out-of-network providers (including Guam).  
                   Under a Self Plus One enrollment, the deductible is considered satisfied and benefits are 
                   payable for you and one other eligible family member when the combined covered 
                   expenses applied to the calendar year deductible for your enrollment reach $600 for in-
                   network providers (including Guam) and providers outside the 50 United States or $800 
                   for out-of-network providers (including Guam).  
                   Under a Self and Family enrollment, the deductible is satisfied for all family members 
                   when the combined covered expenses applied to the calendar year deductible for family 
                   members reach $600 for in-network providers (including Guam) and providers outside the 
                   50 United States or $800 for out-of-network providers (including Guam).  
                   If the billed amount or the Plan allowance that providers we contract with have agreed to 
                   accept as payment in full is less than the remaining portion of your deductible, you pay 
                   the lower amount. 
      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 24           Section 4 
                   Example:  If the billed amount is $100, the provider has an agreement with us to accept 
                   $80, and you have not paid any amount toward meeting your calendar year deductible, 
                   you must pay $80.  We will apply $80 to your deductible.  We will begin paying benefits 
                   once the remaining portion of your calendar year deductible ($300 for in-network 
                   (including Guam) and providers outside the 50 United States or $400 for out-of-network 
                   providers (including Guam)) has been satisfied. 
                   Note:  If you change plans during Open Season and the effective date of your new plan is 
                   after January 1 of the next year, you do not have to start a new deductible under your old 
                   plan between January 1 and the effective date of your new plan.  If you change plans at 
                   another time during the year, you must begin a new deductible under your new plan.  
                   If you change options in this Plan during the year, we will credit the amount of covered 
                   expenses already applied toward the deductible of your old option to the deductible of 
                   your new option. 
      Coinsurance  Coinsurance is the percentage of our allowance that you must pay for your care.   
                   Example:  You pay 10% of the Plan allowance for surgery performed by an in-network 
                   provider. 
      If your provider routinely If your provider routinely waives (does not require you to pay) your copayments, 
      waives your costdeductibles, or coinsurance, the provider is misstating the fee and may be violating the 
                   law.  In this case, when we calculate our share, we will reduce the provider’s fee by the 
                   amount waived.  
                   For example, if your out-of-network physician or other health care professional ordinarily 
                   charges $100 for a service but routinely waives your 30% coinsurance, the actual charge is 
                   $70.  We will pay $49 (70% of the actual charge of $70). 
      Waivers      In some instances, an in-network provider may ask you to sign a “waiver” prior to 
                   receiving care.  This waiver may state that you accept responsibility for the total charge, 
                   including any charges above the negotiated amount, for any care that is not covered by 
                   your health plan.  If you sign such a waiver, whether you are responsible for the total 
                   charge depends on the contracts that the Plan has with its providers.  If you are asked to 
                   sign this type of waiver, please be aware that, if benefits are denied for the services, you 
                   could be legally liable for the related expenses.  If you would like more information about 
                   waivers, please contact us at 202-833-4910. 
      Differences between our Our “Plan allowance” is the amount we use to calculate our payment for covered 
      allowance and the billservices.  Fee-for-service plans arrive at their allowances in different ways, so their 
                   allowances vary.  For more information about how we determine our Plan allowance, see 
                   the definition of Plan allowance in Section 10, Definitions.  
                   Often, the provider’s bill is more than a fee-for-service plan’s allowance.  Whether or not 
                   you have to pay the difference between our allowance and the bill will depend on the 
                   provider you use. 
                   You should use an in-network provider.  The following two examples explain how we will 
                   handle your bill when you go to an in-network provider and when you go to an out-of-
                   network provider.  When you use an in-network provider, the amount you pay is much 
                   less. 
      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 25           Section 4 
                      In-network providers (including Guam) agree to limit what they will bill you. 
                     Because of that, when you use an in-network provider, your share of covered charges 
                     consists only of your deductible and coinsurance.  Here is an example about 
                     coinsurance:  You see an in-network physician or other health care professional who 
                     charges $150, but our allowance is $100.  If you have met your deductible, you are 
                     only responsible for your coinsurance.  That is, you pay just 10% of our $100 
                     allowance ($10).  Because of the agreement, your in-network physician or other health 
                     care professional will not bill you for the $50 difference between our allowance and 
                     his/her bill.  Follow these procedures when you use an in-network provider in 
                     order to receive in-network benefits: 
                     -   Verify that the provider is in the network when you make your appointment. 
                      Confirm that the address for your appointment is the same location as on our 
                      website.  Providers may choose to be an in-network provider at one location 
                      but not at another;   
                     -   Present your Foreign Service Benefit Plan Identification (ID) card at the time 
                      you visit your health care provider, confirming in-network participation in 
                      order to receive in-network benefits and the provider’s continued participation 
                      in our network.  If you do not present your ID card, the provider may not give 
                      you the in-network discount; and
                     -   Generally, you do not pay an in-network provider at the time of service.  In-
                      network providers must bill us directly.  We must reimburse the provider 
                      directly. In-network providers will bill you for any balance after our payment 
                      to them.
                      Out-of-network providers, on the other hand, have no agreement to limit what they 
                     will bill you.  For instance: 
                     -   When you use an out-of-network provider, you will pay your deductible and 
                      coinsurance plus any difference between our allowance and charges on the bill. 
                      Here is an example: You see an out-of-network physician or other health care 
                      professional who charges $150 and our allowance is again $100.  If you have met 
                      your deductible, you are responsible for your coinsurance, so you pay 30% of our 
                      $100 allowance ($30).  Plus, because there is no agreement between the out-of-
                      network physician or other health care professional and us, the physician or other 
                      health care professional can bill you for the $50 difference between our allowance 
                      and his/her bill. 
                      Other participating providers (See Section 1, Facts about this fee-for-service 
                     Plan) agree to limit what they will bill you. You still will have to pay your deductible 
                     and the out-of-network benefit level.  These providers have agreed not to bill you for 
                     the difference between the billed charges and the discounted amount.   
                      Providers outside the 50 United States charges generally are not subject to a Plan 
                     allowance, that is, our Plan allowance is the amount billed by the provider or as part of 
                     our Direct Billing Arrangements.  Similar to the in-network example above, when you 
                     use a provider outside the 50 United States and you have met your deductible, you are 
                     responsible for your coinsurance. You will pay just 10% of the charge ($15). 
                     Generally, you do not pay a provider in our Direct Billing Arrangement. We must 
                     reimburse the provider directly for any covered expenses. You are responsible, 
                     however, for any deductible and coinsurance, which we do not reimburse. See Section 
                     7 for more information. 
                   The table on the next page illustrates the examples of how much you have to pay out-of-
                   pocket for medical services from an in-network provider vs. an out-of-network provider 
                   (including Guam) vs. a provider outside the 50 United States.  The table uses our example 
                   of a service for which the provider charges $150 and our allowance is $100.  The table 
                   shows the amount you pay if you have met your calendar year deductible.

                   For Self Plus One and Self and Family enrollments, once any individual family member 
                   reaches the Self Only catastrophic protection out-of-pocket maximum during the calendar 
                   year, that member’s claims will no longer be subject to associated cost-sharing amounts 
                   for the rest of the year. All other family members will be required to meet the balance of 
                   the catastrophic protection out-of-pocket maximum. 
                   Any expenses incurred that apply toward the catastrophic out-of-pocket maximum for in-
                   network or out-of-network apply toward both in and out-of-network limits. 
                   This catastrophic protection out-of-pocket maximum is combined for medical/surgical, 
                   mental health/substance misuse disorder, and pharmacy. 
                   The following cannot be counted toward catastrophic protection out-of-pocket expenses: 
                      Expenses in excess of Plan allowances, maximum benefit or visit limitations; 
                      Expenses for a transplant above the $400,000 maximum in-network benefit or 
                     expenses at an out-of-network facility; 
                      Expenses for dental care; 
                      Any amounts you pay because benefits have been reduced for non-compliance with

        Carryover        If you changed to this Plan during Open Season from a plan with a catastrophic protection 
                         benefit and the effective date of the change was after January 1, any expenses that would 
                         have applied to that plan’s catastrophic protection benefit during the prior year will be 
                         covered by your old plan if they are for care you received in January before your effective 
                         date of coverage in this Plan.  If you have already met your old plan’s catastrophic 
                         protection benefit level in full, it will continue to apply until the effective date of your 
                         coverage in this Plan. If you have not met this expense level in full, your old plan will first 
                         apply your covered out-of-pocket expenses until the prior year’s catastrophic level is 
                         reached and then apply the catastrophic protection benefit to covered out-of-pocket 
                         expenses incurred from that point until the effective date of your coverage in this Plan.  
                         Your old plan will pay these covered expenses according to this year’s benefits; benefit 
                         changes are effective January 1.

        Section 5(c). Services provided by a hospital or other facility, and ambulance 
                             services 
         Important things you should keep in mind about these benefits:
          Please remember that all benefits are subject to the definitions, limitations, and exclusions in this brochure 
          and are payable only when we determine they are medically necessary. 
          In this Section, unlike other subsections in Section 5, the calendar year deductible applies to only a few 
          benefits. We added “(calendar year deductible applies)”. The calendar year deductible is: $300 per person 
          ($600 per Self Plus One enrollment or $600 per Self and Family enrollment) for in-network providers 
          (including Guam) and providers outside the 50 United States; or $400 per person ($800 per Self Plus One 
          enrollment or $800 per Self and Family enrollment) for out-of-network providers (including Guam). 
          The out-of-network benefits are the standard benefits of this Plan.  In-network benefits (including Guam) 
          apply only when you use an in-network provider or when you use a provider outside the 50 United States.  
          When no in-network provider is available in the network, out-of-network benefits apply. 
          When you use an in-network facility (including Guam), keep in mind that the health care professionals who 
          provide services to you in the facility may not be in-network providers. We will pay up to the Plan 
          allowance at the in-network provider percentage for services you receive from out-of-network 
          anesthesiologists (including Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists), radiologists, pathologists, emergency 
          room physicians, hospitalists, intensivists and neonatologists. This provision also applies when an out-of-
          network surgeon’s immediate or emergency care is required. You will be responsible to pay the in-network 
          coinsurance and any difference between the Plan allowance and billed amount for these out-of-network 
          providers.  When non-emergency care by out-of-network surgeons is provided, regular out-of-network 
          benefits apply. 
                     Your costs for covered services, for valuable information about how cost-sharing 
          Be sure to read Section 4, 
          works.  Also, read Section 9 for information about how we pay if you have other coverage, or if you are age 
          65 or over. 
          The amounts listed on the following pages are for the charges billed by the facility (i.e., hospital or surgical 
          center) or ambulance service for your surgery or care. Any costs associated with the professional charges (i.
          e., physicians, etc.) and supplies are in Sections 5(a), (b), (d) or (e), except when billed by the hospital or 
          skilled nursing facility. 
          Note: Observation care is billed as outpatient facility care. As a result, benefits for observation care services 
          are provided at the outpatient facility benefit levels (see Section 10, Definitions). Observation stays for 
          more than 24 hours require prior approval. See Section 3, Other services for additional details on prior 
          approval. 
          YOUR NETWORK PHYSICAN, HOSPITAL, OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY MUST 
          PRECERTIFY HOSPITAL OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY STAYS AND 
          CONCURRENT CARE (FOR DAYS BEYOND THE PLAN’S INITIAL APPROVAL) FOR IN-
          NETWORK FACILITY CARE. YOU MUST PRECERTIFY HOSPITAL OR SKILLED FACILITY 
          STAYS AND CONCURRENT CARE FOR OUT-OF-NETWORK FACILITY CARE; FAILURE TO 
          DO SO WILL RESULT IN A $500 PENALTY FOR OUT-OF-NETWORK FACILITY CARE. Please 
          refer to the precertification information shown in Section 3 to confirm which services require 
          precertification. 
         Note: We do not require precertification, prior approval, or concurrent review in this section for services you 
         receive outside the 50 United States (including Guam). However, the Plan will review all services to establish 
         medical necessity or to confirm coverage. We may request medical records in order to determine medical 
         necessity or to confirm coverage before and/or during continued treatment. 
         Note: We do not require precertification, prior approval, or concurrent review when Medicare Part A and/or 
         Part B or another group health insurance policy is the primary payor. However, precertification or 
         preauthorization is required when Medicare or the other group health insurance policy stops paying benefits 
         for any reason.

      Note: We only cover a private room when you must be isolated to prevent copayment per hospital stay and 20% of the 
      contagion. Otherwise, we will pay the hospital’s average charge for semiprivate Plan allowance and any difference between our 
      accommodations. If the hospital only has private rooms, then we will consider allowance and the billed amount 
      the private room rate.           Providers outside the 50 United States (does 
      Note: Staying overnight in a hospital does not always mean you are an not include Guam): Nothing 
      inpatient. You are considered an inpatient the day a physician formally admits 
      you to a hospital with a physician's order. Confinement as an inpatient or an 
      outpatient affects your out-of-pocket expenses. Always ask your physician or 
      the hospital staff if you are an inpatient, outpatient, or observation care.   
      Although you may stay overnight in a hospital room and receive meals and 
      other hospital services, some hospital services including “observation care” are 
      actually outpatient care. Since observation services are billed as outpatient care, 
      outpatient facility benefit levels apply and your out-of-pocket expenses may be 
      higher as a result (see this Section, Outpatient hospital or ambulatory surgical 
      center). If you are admitted to the hospital as an inpatient after your observation 
      care ends, you must precertify the inpatient admission per Section 3. 
      Other services and supplies you receive while in a hospital, such as: 
        Use of operating, recovery, maternity, and other treatment rooms 
        Rehabilitative services 
        Prescribed drugs and medicines for use in the hospital 
        X-ray, laboratory, and pathology services and machine diagnostic tests

        Special Overseas Benefit  –  Inpatient private duty nursing services by an 
       R.N. or L.P.N. when the services are rendered outside the 50 United States 
      Note: We base our benefits on whether the facility or a health care professional 
      bills for the services or supplies. For example, charges for professional services 
      such as surgery, anesthesiology, medical or therapy services, etc., we pay the 
      specific surgery, anesthesia, medical or therapy benefit under Section 5(a) and 
      the calendar year deductible applies, except when billed by the hospital. 
      Note: We cover hospital services and supplies related to dental procedures 
      when necessitated by a non-dental physical impairment to safeguard the health 
      of the patient, even though we may not cover the services of dentists, 
      physicians, or other health care professionals in connection with the dental 
      treatment.

     What is an accidental injury?
     An accidental injury is a bodily injury that requires immediate medical attention and is sustained solely through violent, external, 
     and accidental means, such as broken bones, animal bites, insect bites and stings, and poisonings. We cover dental care required 
     as a result of an accidental injury under Section 5(g), Dental benefits.  
     What is a medical emergency?
     A medical emergency is the sudden and unexpected onset of a condition or an injury that you believe endangers your life or 
     could result in serious injury or disability and requires immediate medical or surgical care. Medical emergencies include heart 
     attacks, cardiovascular accidents, loss of consciousness or respiration, convulsions, and such other acute conditions that we 
     determine to be medical emergencies.

           Section 5(e). Mental health and substance misuse disorder benefits 
         You may choose to get care from an in-network or an out-of-network provider if you live in the 50 United 
         States (including Guam).  When you receive any care in the 50 United States, you must get our prior approval 
         for inpatient hospitalization and partial hospitalization (does not include Guam).  Cost-sharing and limitations 
         for mental health and substance misuse disorder benefits are no greater than for similar benefits for other 
         illnesses and conditions. 
         Important things you should keep in mind about these benefits:
          Please remember that all benefits are subject to the definitions, limitations, and exclusions in this brochure 
          and are payable only when we determine they are medically necessary. 
          The calendar year deductible or, for facility care, the inpatient copayment applies to almost all benefits in 
          this Section. We added “(No deductible)” to show when the calendar year deductible does not apply. 
          The out-of-network benefits are the standard benefits of this Plan.  In-network benefits (including 
          Guam) apply only when you use an in-network provider or when you use a provider outside the 50 United 
          States.  When no in-network provider is available in the network, out-of-network benefits apply.   
          Be sure to read Section 4, Your costs for covered services, for valuable information about how cost-sharing 
          works.  Also, read Section 9 for information about how we pay if you have other coverage, or if you are age 
          65 or over. 
          YOUR NETWORK PHYSICIAN OR HOSPITAL MUST PRECERTIFY OR OBTAIN PRIOR

           the admission or care. 
         Note: We do not require precertification, prior approval or concurrent review for continuing care in this 
         Section for services you receive outside the 50 United States (including Guam), except for ABA assessment or 
         treatment
             . However, the Plan will review all services to establish medical necessity or to confirm coverage. 
         We may request medical records in order to determine medical necessity. 
         Note: We do not require precertification, prior approval or concurrent review when Medicare Part A and/or 
         Part B or another group health insurance policy is the primary payor.  However, precertification, prior 
         approval, and concurrent review for continuing care is required for inpatient, partial hospitalization or for 
         ABA assessment or treatment when Medicare or the other group health insurance policy stops paying benefits 
         for any reason.

                    Section 5(f). Prescription drug benefits 
        Important things you should keep in mind about these benefits:
         We cover prescribed drugs and medications, as described in this Section, Covered medications and supplies. 
         Please remember that all benefits are subject to the definitions, limitations and exclusions in this brochure and 
         are payable only when we determine they are medically necessary. 
         Federal law prevents the pharmacy from accepting unused medications. 
         The calendar year deductible is: $300 per person ($600 per Self Plus One enrollment or $600 per Self and 
         Family enrollment) for in-network providers (including Guam) and providers outside the 50 United States; or 
         $400 per person ($800 per Self Plus One enrollment or $800 per Self and Family enrollment) for out-of-network 
         providers (including Guam). The calendar year deductible does not apply to any benefits in this Section.  We 
         added “(No deductible)” to show when the calendar year deductible does not apply.   
                    Your costs for covered services, for valuable information about how cost-sharing 
         Be sure to read Section 4, 
         works.  Also, read Section 9 for information about how we pay if you have other coverage, or if you are age 65 
         or over. 
         During the year, the Plan’s formulary may change. Tier changes for brand medications (including specialty) may 
         occur due to generic availability, cost increases or safety concerns. Tier changes are not considered benefit 
         changes. 
         During the year, the Plan may implement new health and safety programs, as they become available. These 
         programs may focus on appropriate dosing, preferred therapy and/or adherence as examples. 
         To manage an affordable prescription benefit, it is important the Plan react to excessive cost increases. Safety 
         and efficacy of medication will remain a priority. However, one drug may be more cost effective than another. 
         During the course of the year, the Plan may act upon excessive cost increases and cover a less costly medication 
         in the same therapeutic class. 
         YOU MUST GET PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR CERTAIN DRUGS, INCLUDING SPECIALTY 
         DRUGS AND CERTAIN SPECIALTY DRUGS SUPPLIED BY PRESCRIBER'S OFFICES AND 
         OUTPATIENT FACILITIES; AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION MUST BE RENEWED 
         PERIODICALLY. Prior authorization uses Plan rules based on FDA-approved prescribing and safety 
         information, and clinical guidelines and uses that are considered reasonable, safe, and effective. See the prior 
         authorization information shown in Section 3, Other Services and in this Section, Prescription Drug Utilization 
         Management, for more information about this important program. 
        Note: We do not require prior authorization in this section for medications you purchase from a retail pharmacy or 
        Military Treatment Facility (MTF) outside the 50 United States (except in Guam, if you use your Plan ID card). 
        However, the Plan will review all services to establish medical necessity. We may request medical records in order 
        to determine medical necessity before and/or during continued treatment. 
        Note: We do not require prior authorization when Medicare Part A, Part B and/or Part D or another group health 
        insurance policy is the primary payor. However, prior authorization is required when Medicare or the other group 
        health insurance policy stops paying benefits for any reason.

     Participating Smart90 Retail Network pharmacies within the 50 United States
      -  Your prescriber must be licensed in the United States.
      -  To avoid paying full cost for your non-specialty maintenance prescription medications (drugs you take regularly for ongoing 
       conditions) after two 30-day retail courtesy fills, you must obtain a 90-day supply at a participating Smart90 Retail Network 
       pharmacy through the Smart90 Program or through the Express Scripts Pharmacy (home delivery).  You can transfer your 
       non-specialty maintenance prescription medications to a participating Smart90 Retail Network pharmacy.  The pharmacist can 
       contact your doctor to get a new 90-day prescription or have your doctor write a new prescription for a 90-day supply and take it to a 
       participating Smart90 Retail Network pharmacy. 
      -  Your copayment for your 90-day supply will be the same whether you fill your prescriptions through Express Scripts home delivery 
       or at a participating Smart90 Retail Network pharmacy. After two courtesy fills at retail, you will pay full cost of maintenance 
                                                                    ®

     The Plan participates in the SafeGuardRx program through Express Scripts. This suite of programs addresses specific chronic 
      therapeutic conditions and focuses on reducing cost and improving care. The emphasis is on ensuring members receive appropriate 
      therapy and specialized care for their condition to achieve better therapy outcomes and remain adherent. The programs may include 
      prior authorization, step therapy and quantity limits. Some medications may be preferred over others based on FDA indications. These 
      programs may require that you receive your medications from a specific network pharmacy. You will pay the full cost for your 
      medications at any other retail network pharmacy after two courtesy fills. Medications used to treat high cholesterol, diabetes, asthma/
      COPD and multiple sclerosis are a few of the targeted therapies. The Plan will incorporate additional therapies where appropriate to 
      address our members’ needs. The Plan will grandfather members who are stabilized on a clinically appropriate treatment that is 
      included in the program. To find a specific network pharmacy participating in the SafeGuardRx program in the United States or to 
      obtain additional information, contact Express Scripts at 800-818-6717. In addition, Home Delivery through Express-Scripts.com 
      participates in the SafeGuardRx program. 
     Out-of-network pharmacies in the 50 United States
      -  Prescriptions you purchase at out-of-network pharmacies in the 50 United States are not covered. 
                                SM
     Home Delivery (the Express Scripts Pharmacy) within the 50 United States 
      -  Your prescriber must be licensed in the United States.
      -  If your physician prescribes a new medication that will be taken over an extended period of time and you prefer to receive your 
       maintenance prescription medications (drugs you take regularly for ongoing conditions) through the mail, you should request two 
       prescriptions – one to be used at a participating retail network pharmacy (for up to a 30-day supply) and the other for Home Delivery 
       (for up to a 90-day supply). 
      -  You will receive forms for refills and future prescription orders each time you receive drugs or supplies through Home Delivery. 
        -  To order by mail: 1) Complete the initial Home Delivery form; 2) Enclose your prescription and copayment; 3) Mail your order to 
        Express Scripts, Home Delivery Service, P.O. Box 747000, Cincinnati, OH 45274-7000 (do not mail your order to the Plan); and 
        4) Allow approximately two weeks for delivery. 
        -  Log in at www.express-scripts.com  or call 800-818-6717 to learn how to get started with home delivery.  Express Scripts can 
        contact your doctor to have a new 90-day prescription sent right to you. 
      -  You also may order refills on the Internet by logging in at Express-Scripts.com. Using the Internet saves you time and effort for 
       refills. If you have any questions about a particular drug or a prescription, or to request order forms, you may call 800-818-6717 in 
       the United States. Prescriptions you purchase through home delivery from a source other than the Express Scripts Pharmacy or 
       Accredo Health Group (Accredo), the Plan's specialty pharmacy, are not covered. 
     Retail pharmacies outside the 50 United States
      -  Fill your prescription as you normally do. Mail claims for prescription drugs and supplies you purchased through a retail pharmacy 
       outside the 50 United States to the Plan’s address shown in Section 7, Filing a claim for covered services (do not mail foreign 
       prescription claims to the Express Scripts Pharmacy). Claims must include receipts that show the name of the patient, 
       prescription number, name of drug(s), name of the prescriber, name of the pharmacy, date, and the charge. You may obtain claim 
       forms by calling 202-833-4910 or from our website at www.AFSPA.org/FSBP. 
     Home Delivery (the Express Scripts Pharmacy) outside the 50 United States
      -  Your prescriber must be licensed in the United States. 
      -  Use the same forms as for home delivery within the 50 United States referenced above. If you have any questions about a particular 
       drug or a prescription or to request order forms, you may call 800-497-4641 (available in over 140 countries) from outside the 50 
       United States. Also, you can call the Express Scripts Pharmacy collect at 724-765-3077 or 724-765-3074 if the toll-free number for 
       outside the 50 United States does not work for you. In addition, you may contact Express Scripts' Expatriate Team at 
       ExpressprocessingGen@express-scripts.com. 
      -  Note: Per Federal regulations, the Express Scripts Pharmacy can mail only to addresses in the United States or to APO, FPO, 
       DPO, and Pouch Mail addresses. Allow appropriate mailing time to reach them, for them to fill your prescription, and for the 
       prescription to reach you. 
      -  If you are posted, living, or traveling outside the 50 United States, you may request up to a 1-year supply of most medications. Ask 
       your prescriber to write you a prescription for a 1-year supply with no refills. Contact the Plan or refer to our website if you need 
       additional assistance. There are limitations to sending temperature sensitive medications outside the 50 United States. Please contact 
       the Express Scripts Pharmacy if you have been prescribed a temperature sensitive medication.

                                                 High Option 
    -  You also may order refills on the Internet by logging in at Express-Scripts.com.  Using the Internet saves you considerable time for 
     refills compared to APO/FPO/DPO and Pouch Mail. 
   These are the dispensing limitations.
    The Plan follows Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. 
    You may purchase up to a 30-day supply of medication at a network pharmacy. Refills cannot be obtained until 50% of the drug has 
    been used. 
    You must purchase non-specialty maintenance prescription medications (drugs you take regularly for ongoing 
    conditions) through a participating Smart90 Retail Network pharmacy or the Express Scripts Pharmacy (home delivery) after 
    two courtesy fills at regular network retail. Per the home delivery reference on the previous page, if you are posted, living or 
    traveling outside the 50 United States, you may request up to a 1-year supply of most medications.    
    You may not obtain more than a 30-day supply through the network pharmacy arrangement except in the following situations: 
    -  You are traveling to a foreign country, do not have time to use the Express Scripts Pharmacy (home delivery) and need to purchase 
     more than a 30-day supply of prescriptions to take with you; 
    -  You are visiting the United States for a short time period, do not have time to use the Express Scripts Pharmacy and need to purchase 
     more than a 30-day supply of prescriptions to take with you; and 
    -  You use the Smart90 Retail Program described above and on page 72. 
    We cover all drugs and supplies referenced on the following pages except for those that require constant temperature control 
    (temperature sensitive), are too heavy to mail, or that must be administered by a prescriber. 
    As stated on the previous page, per Federal regulations, the Express Scripts Pharmacy (home delivery) can mail only to 
    addresses in the United States or to APO, FPO, DPO, and Pouch Mail addresses.
    You may not obtain hormone therapy treatment (for infertility) with your Foreign Service Benefit Plan ID Card or through the 
    Express Scripts Pharmacy (home delivery). 
   Prescription Drug Utilization Management
   The Plan's prescription drug utilization management programs help ensure that you receive the prescription drugs you need at a 
   reasonable cost. The information below and on the next few pages describes the features of these programs and explains how the Plan 
   will cover certain medications. 
   To find out if your prescription is affected by our prescription drug utilization management programs, visit the Express Scripts Pharmacy 
   online at www.express-scripts.com. If you are a first-time visitor to the site, register with your member ID, or call their Member Services 
   at 800-818-6717. Members outside the United States who use Express Scripts home delivery may call 800-497-4641 (available in over 
   140 countries). Also, you can call the Express Scripts Pharmacy collect at 412-829-5932 or 412-829-5933 if the toll-free number for 
   outside the 50 United States does not work for you. In addition, if you are outside the U.S., you may contact Express Script’s Expatriate 
   Team at ExpressprocessingGen@express-scripts.com. 
    Prior authorization review may be required: Some medications are not covered unless you receive approval through a coverage 
    review (prior authorization). See below for important information.
    -  Prior authorization review uses Plan rules based on FDA-approved prescribing and safety information, and clinical guidelines and 
     uses that are considered reasonable, safe, and effective. There are other medications that may be covered with limits (for example, 
     only for a certain amount or for certain uses) unless you receive approval through a coverage review. Examples of drug categories 
     requiring prior authorization include, but are not limited to, growth hormones, certain hormone therapies, interferons, erythroid 
     stimulants, anti-narcoleptics, sleep aids, migraine medication, weight loss medications, opioids, and oncologic agents. During this 
     review, the Express Scripts Pharmacy asks your prescriber for more information than what is on the prescription before the 
     medication may be covered under the Plan. If coverage is approved, you simply pay your normal copayment for the medication. If 
     coverage is not approved, you will be responsible for the full cost of the medication.
   2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 74        High Option Section 5(f) 
                                                 High Option 
    Quantity Management
    -  The Drug Quantity Management program manages prescription costs by ensuring that the quantity of units and/or number of refills 
     supplied for each copayment are consistent with clinical dosing guidelines. The program is designed to support safe, effective, and 
     economic use of drugs while giving patients access to quality care. 
    Step Therapy (Non-specialty and specialty)
    -  Within specific therapy classes, multiple drugs are available to treat the same condition. Step Therapy manages drug costs by 
     ensuring that patients try frontline (first step), clinically effective, lower-cost medications before they “step up” to a higher-cost 
     medication. 
    -  The Step Therapy program applies edits to drugs in specific therapeutic classes at the point of sale. Coverage for back-up therapies 
     (second/third step) is determined at the patient level based on the presence or absence of front-line drugs. 
    The Plan participates in other managed care programs, as deemed necessary, to insure patient safety and appropriate 
    quantities in accordance with the Plan rules based on FDA-approved guidelines referenced on the previous pages.
   Specialty Drugs
   Specialty drugs, which can be given by any route of administration and are typically used to treat chronic, complex conditions, are 
   defined as having one or more of several key characteristics, including: 
    The requirement for frequent dosing adjustments and intensive clinical monitoring to decrease the potential for drug toxicity and 
    increase the probability for beneficial treatment outcomes; 
    The need for intensive patient training and compliance assistance to facilitate therapeutic goals; 
    Limited or exclusive specialty pharmacy distribution; 
    Specialized product handling and/or administration requirements; 
    Exceptions may exist based on certain characteristics of the drug or therapy which will still require the drug to be classified as a 
    specialty drug; and 
    Some examples of the disease categories currently in the Plan's specialty pharmacy programs include cancer, cystic fibrosis, Gaucher 
    disease, growth hormone deficiency, hemophilia, immune deficiency, Hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and RSV 
    prophylaxis. 
   You are required to obtain all specialty drugs used for long term therapy (chronic specialty drugs) from Accredo (home delivery), 
   your exclusive Specialty Pharmacy. 
    Express Scripts customer service can advise you if your prescription is required to be obtained from Accredo and cannot be obtained 
    from a retail pharmacy.  Your prescriber can fax your prescription directly to Accredo at 800-391-9707 or you can mail your 
    prescription to: Express Scripts, P.O. Box 747000, Cincinnati, OH 45274-7000.  
    If you purchase your chronic specialty drugs from a retail pharmacy, you will be responsible for their full cost. Note:  This does not 
    apply to specialty medications you purchase from a retail pharmacy or Military Treatment Facility outside the 50 United States.  You 
    file a claim for them as you would for other medications purchased in this manner. 
   In addition, certain specialty drugs must be obtained from Accredo (home delivery) and not from your prescriber's office or 
   outpatient facility. See below for important information. 
    You or your prescriber can contact Express Scripts at 800-922-8279 to speak to an Accredo representative to inquire if your drug 
    should be obtained through Accredo.  If you currently are using a specialty drug supplied by the prescriber’s office or an outpatient 
    facility, you may be required to obtain the drug from Accredo.  
    Nursing services are provided by Accredo when necessary.  
    If you continue to purchase your drugs from your prescriber, outpatient facility, or another pharmacy, you will be responsible for their 
    full cost.  Note:  This does not apply to specialty drugs you obtain from a provider or Military Treatment Facility outside the 50 United 
    States.  You file a claim for them as you would for other drugs purchased in this manner. 
   2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 75        High Option Section 5(f) 
                                                 High Option 
   General specialty drug information:
    Accredo provides patient support and instructions on administering the drug. 
    Most specialty drugs require special handling and cannot be shipped to APO/FPO/DPO and Pouch Mail addresses. 
    Not all network retail pharmacies carry specialty drugs. Contact Accredo at 800-922-8279 for more information. 
    Fertility drugs are covered only as specified under Section 5(a), Infertility services. 
   Compound Medication
   You should contact Express Scripts Member Services at 800-818-6717 before you fill your compound medication prescription to 
   determine if it is covered by the Plan. 
    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a compound medication as one that requires a licensed pharmacist to combine, 
    mix or alter the ingredients of a medication when filling a prescription.  Pharmacies must submit all ingredients in a compound 
    prescription as part of the claim for both online claims and paper claim submissions.  All ingredients submitted with the compound 
    prescription claim must be covered and at least one of the ingredients must require a physician’s prescription in order to be considered 
    for reimbursement by the Plan. 
    Prescriptions containing certain ingredients (such as, over-the-counter (OTC) products, bulk powders, kits, solid dosage forms, and 
    proprietary bases) when compounded for dispensing are not covered through the prescription benefit. Investigational drugs are not 
    FDA approved.  If the compound includes an investigational drug, the compound will not be covered. 
    -  In addition, certain topical analgesics for the temporary relief of minor aches and muscle pains may be marketed contrary to the 
     Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) and are excluded by the Plan. Your prescription drug benefit includes other 
     medications that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the temporary relief of minor aches and muscle 
     pains by means of the prescribed route of administration. 
   The Plan participates in a formulary.
   The Plan’s Formulary includes a list of preferred drugs and non-preferred drugs.  Preferred drugs are drugs that are either more effective 
   at treating a particular condition than other drugs in the same class of drugs, or as effective as and less costly than similar medications. 
   Non-preferred drugs also may be covered under the prescription drug benefit, but at a higher cost-sharing tier.  The Plan’s Formulary is 
   updated periodically and subject to change. 
   To get the most up-to-date list go online to www.express-scripts.com.  Drugs that are excluded from the Plan’s Formulary are not covered 
   under the Plan unless approved in advance through a Formulary exception process managed by Express Scripts on the basis that the drug 
   requested is (1) medically necessary and essential to your health and safety and/or (2) all Formulary drugs comparable to the excluded 
   drug have been tried by you.  If approved through that process, the non-preferred co-pay would apply for the approved drug based on the 
   Plan’s cost share structure.   Absent such approval if you obtain drugs excluded from the Formulary you will pay the full cost of the drug 
   without any reimbursement under the Plan. If your prescriber believes that an excluded drug meets the requirements described above, the 
   prescriber may take the necessary steps to initiate a Formulary exception review.  
   The Formulary will continue to change from time to time.  
   Please be sure to check before the drug is purchased to make sure it is covered on the Formulary, as you may not have received notice that 
   a drug has been removed from the Formulary.  Certain drugs, even if covered on the Formulary, will require prior authorization in 
   advance of receiving the drug.  Other Formulary-covered drugs may not be covered under the Plan unless an established protocol is 
   followed first; this is known as Step Therapy and described on page 75.  As with all aspects of the Formulary, these requirements may 
   also change from time to time. 
   2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 76        High Option Section 5(f) 
                                                 High Option 
   Six-tier drug benefit – We divide prescription drugs into six tiers. The six-tier drug benefit is not applicable to prescription drugs 
   you purchase from a retail pharmacy or Military Treatment Facility (MTF) outside the 50 United States and file as a claim (see 
   pages 73 and 80-82 for information on claims from outside the 50 United States). 
    Tier I (Generic Drug): Generic drugs are chemically and therapeutically equivalent to their corresponding brand name drugs, but cost 
    less. The FDA must approve all generic versions of a drug and assure that they meet strict standards for quality, strength and purity. The 
    FDA requires that generic equivalent medications contain the same active ingredients and be equivalent in strength and dosage to brand 
    name drugs. The main difference between a generic and its brand name drug is the cost of the product.  Generic drugs are preferred by 
    the Plan. 
    Tier II (Preferred Brand Name Drug): Single-source brand name drugs are available from only one manufacturer and are patent-
    protected. No generic equivalent is available. Certain brands are preferred by the Plan and included in the Plan formulary. 
    Tier III (Non-Preferred Brand Name Drug): Non-preferred drugs consist of multi-source brand drugs and single source brand 
    drugs.  Multi-source brand name drugs are brand name drugs for which the patent protection has expired. As a result, generic 
    equivalent drugs are available. When an approved generic equivalent is available, that is the drug you will receive, unless you or your 
    prescriber specifies that the prescription must be filled as written (“Dispense as Written – DAW”). If an approved generic equivalent 
    is available, but you or your prescriber specifies that the prescription must be filled as written, you will pay the Level III Non-
    Preferred copay. 
    Tier IV (Generic Specialty Drugs): Specialty drugs are described on pages 75-76. The Generic Specialty Drug definition is the same 
    as Tier I, above. 
    Tier V (Preferred Brand Name Specialty Drugs): Preferred Specialty medications are those branded medications included on the 
    Plan formulary. 
    Tier VI (Non-Preferred Brand Name Specialty Drugs): Non-Preferred Specialty medications are those branded medications 
    included on the Plan formulary, but require a higher copay than the Generic and Preferred Specialty medication. Speak with your 
    physician about which medication is appropriate for you. 
   Personalized Medicine Program
    Your prescription drug coverage includes the Personalized Medicine Program, a program that incorporates pharmacogenetic testing to 
    optimize prescription drug therapies for certain conditions such as those prescribed to determine the tolerance of anticoagulant 
    medications or prevent major adverse cardiovascular events. The conditions, drugs, and testing covered by the program will change 
    from time to time as new genetic tests become available that are recommended by the FDA and are included in the program. The most 
    up-to-date information on the conditions and drugs covered by the program can be accessed online at the Plan’s co-branded website at 
    www.AFSPA.org/FSBP  and clicking on the “Prescription” tab or by calling an Express Scripts Pharmacy customer service 
    representative at 800-818-6717. 
    If you are a qualified participant, services are available to you through the Personalized Medicine Program at no additional cost. The 
    Personalized Medicine Program includes: (i) access to certain specified pharmacogenetic tests administered and analyzed by one of 
    several designated clinical laboratories; and (ii) a clinical program that includes consultation with the prescriber of your test by a 
    representative of the Express Scripts Pharmacy trained specifically in pharmacogenetic testing. The Pharmacy also will offer on-going 
    outreach and education to prescribers and patients when appropriate. 
    When you qualify, the Express Scripts Pharmacy will contact you and/or your prescriber to enroll you in the program. With approval 
    from your prescriber, the clinical laboratory will facilitate the processing of a pharmacogenetic test and share the results of the test with 
    your prescriber and the Pharmacy. The results of the pharmacogenetic test are for informational purposes only. Any dosing or 
    medication changes remain the sole discretion of your prescriber. Your participation is voluntary and, if you decide to participate, the 
    Pharmacy will facilitate your coverage under the Program.  You pay nothing for this service. 
   When you do have to file a claim.
    See Where you can obtain your prescription at the beginning of this Section for instructions when you purchase prescriptions from a 
    retail pharmacy or Military Treatment Facility outside the 50 United States. 
    When you must file a claim for a prescription medication you purchased without your Foreign Service Benefit Plan ID card (in the 
    United States), please submit a letter explaining why you were unable to use your ID card and include the itemized pharmacy receipt 
    from a network pharmacy. The submission must be itemized and show:

   Information about prescription drug coordination of benefits (COB) with Medicare Part B and/or Part D
   Retail: 
    If you have Medicare Part B or Part D, be sure to present your Medicare ID card whenever using a retail pharmacy. If your medication 
    or supplies are eligible for Medicare Part B or Part D, the retail pharmacy will submit your claim first to Medicare and then to the Plan 
    for you. Most independent pharmacies and national chains are Medicare providers. To find a retail pharmacy near you that is a 
    Medicare B- or D-participating pharmacy, please visit the Medicare website at www.medicare.gov/supplier/home.asp or call Medicare 
    Customer Service at 800-633-4227. 
   Home delivery: 
    To receive your Medicare Part B-eligible medications and supplies by mail, send your home delivery prescriptions to the Express 
    Scripts Pharmacy. They will review the prescriptions to determine if they are eligible for Medicare Part B coverage. 
    When Medicare Part B is primary, contact Medicare at www.medicare.gov/supplier/home.asp or call Medicare at 800-633-4227 about 
    your options for submitting claims for Medicare-covered medications and supplies, whether you use a Medicare-approved supplier or 
    the Express Scripts Pharmacy. Prescriptions typically covered by Medicare Part B include diabetes supplies, specific medications used 
    to aid tissue acceptance (organ transplants), certain oral medications used to treat cancer, and ostomy supplies. 
    Once Medicare Part B pays the claim, it will submit the claim to the Plan for you. 
    To receive your Medicare Part D-eligible medications and supplies by mail, send your home delivery prescriptions to your Medicare 
    Part D Prescription Drug Plan (PDP). If your Medicare Part D PDP is the Express Scripts Pharmacy, they will submit a claim first to 
    Medicare and then to the Plan for you. If your Medicare Part D PDP is not the Express Scripts Pharmacy, you will need to submit a 
    paper claim to the Plan.

    Flexible benefits Under the flexible benefits option, we determine the most effective way to provide services.  
    option     We may identify medically appropriate alternatives to regular contract benefits as a less costly alternative. If 
              we identify a less costly alternative, we will ask you to sign an alternative benefits agreement that will 
              include all of the following terms in addition to other terms as necessary. Until you sign and return the 
              agreement, regular contract benefits will continue. 
               Alternative benefits will be made available for a limited time period and are subject to our ongoing review. 
              You must cooperate with the review process. 
               By approving an alternative benefit, we do not guarantee you will get it in the future.  
               The decision to offer an alternative benefit is solely ours, and except as expressly provided in the agreement, 
              we may withdraw it at any time and resume regular contract benefits.  
               If you sign the agreement, we will provide the agreed-upon alternative benefits for the stated time period 
              (unless circumstances change). You may request an extension of the time period, but regular contract 
              benefits will resume if we do not approve your request. 
               Our decision to offer or withdraw alternative benefits is not subject to OPM review under the disputed 
              claims process.  However, if at the time we make a decision regarding alternative benefits, we also decide 
              that regular contract benefits are not payable, then you may dispute our regular contract benefits decision 
              under the OPM disputed claim process (see Section 8). 
    Electronic Funds You can elect to receive your benefit reimbursement via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) and have payments 
    Transfer (EFT) deposited directly into your U.S. bank account. 
    of claim Some important things to know about signing up for EFT service: 
    reimbursements
               Enrolling for EFT service is easy. Simply complete the Authorization Form in full and return it to the 
              address on the form with a voided check or savings withdrawal slip attached to it. 
               The Authorization Form can be found on the Plan’s Aetna Navigator: 
              -   Visit www.AFSPA.org/FSBP
              -   Select the "Helpful Links" tab and then click on "Aetna Navigator" 
              -   Log on to Aetna Navigator
              -   Select "Forms" 
              -   Select "Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)/Direct Deposit Authorization Form" 
               When you receive benefit reimbursement via EFT, your Explanation of Benefits (EOB) will be available to 
              you on Aetna Navigator and will no longer be mailed to you. Instead, visit the Plan's website at  
              www.AFSPA.org/FSBP  and select “Aetna Navigator”. Log on to Aetna Navigator to view your EOB. 
               Only one bank account per family is permitted. 
               The Plan cannot retrieve funds from your bank account. The Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)/Direct 
              Deposit Authorization Form only allows the Plan to deposit funds into your bank account. 
               The Plan does not charge a fee for EFT service but your bank may charge a small transaction fee. We 
              recommend that you verify with your bank if they will charge you any banking service fees. 
               You may opt to have a paper copy of your EOB mailed to you by checking the box at the bottom of the 
              enrollment form indicating your desire to continue to receive a paper EOB. 
               You have the option to receive benefit reimbursement via check. There is nothing you need to do if you 
              choose this option.

             certifying that you have not received reimbursement for the applicable qualified medical expense and that you 
             will not seek such reimbursement under any other plan or arrangement. If you receive reimbursements from

             secure website. Once a second opinion is obtained, you may proceed with the treatment that was originally

    Aexcel   A guide to the Aexcel specialist performance designation
    Designated Aexcel is our designation for high-performing specialty physicians and physician groups in 12 medical specialty 
    Providersareas: 
               Cardiology 
               Cardiothoracic surgery 
               Gastroenterology

               Plastic surgery 
               Urology 
               Vascular surgery 
             Physicians with the Aexcel specialist designation have met added standards for volume, clinical performance, 
             and efficiency.  Aetna evaluates these providers using specific standards and, based on the results, gives them 
             the Aexcel specialty designation.  
             Visit www.fsbphealth.com, select "Find a Provider" and look for the blue star next to the provider’s name for an 
             Aexcel designated provider. If a specialist does not have a blue star, this does not mean the physician does not 
             provide quality services. It could be that Aetna does not have enough information available to evaluate a 
             particular physician or the physician’s specialty is not one of the 12 specialty categories. The Aexcel 
             information is only a guide. There are many ways to evaluate doctor practices. You should talk with your 
             primary care physician and the specialist you are considering before making a decision. Please note that ratings 
             have a chance for error. An Aexcel designation is not a guarantee of service quality or treatment 
             outcome. Therefore, the Aexcel designation should not be the only reason for choosing a specialty doctor.

                 Non-FEHB benefits available to Plan members 
      The benefits in this Section are not part of the FEHB contract or premium and you cannot file an FEHB disputed claim 
      about them. Fees you pay for these services do not count toward FEHB deductibles, copayments or catastrophic protection 
      out-of-pocket maximums. These programs and materials are the responsibility of the American Foreign Service Protective 
      Association (AFSPA) and all appeals must follow their guidelines. 
       Group Dental AFSPA offers four dental plans to meet our members' needs. Two are Dental Health 
       Insurance  Maintenance Organizations (DHMO’s) available for our stateside members. One plan is 
                  exclusively for the Mid-Atlantic area and the other offers nationwide coverage. The Mid-
                  Atlantic area plan offers a separate orthodontic benefit for adults and children who need that 
                  specific coverage. These DHMO’s do not require claim forms and the member pays reduced 
                  fees for procedures without waiting periods. Members must use a participating dentist in the 
                  network for these services to be covered. 
                  We also offer a Dental Preferred Provider Organization (DPPO) plan that can be used 
                  anywhere in the world. The waiting period applies only for Orthodontia. Adult orthodontia is 
                  covered as well as orthodontia for eligible children up to age 19 after 12 months of being 
                  covered in the plan. 
                  Our international dental plan provides worldwide coverage. However, it pays at a higher 
                  coinsurance rate when services are rendered outside the U.S. than in the U.S. Overseas 
                  services are not subject to a fee schedule or out-of-network penalties.

       Household Health domestic partners, parents and dependent children over age 26 who do not qualify for 
       Insurance  coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. These policies offer a 
                  choice of deductibles and medical coverages. Separate coverage applies for treatment 
                  received inside the U.S. and Canada.  
       Group Disability Our Disability Plans fill a particular gap in coverage when you are unable to work for a long 
       Income Protection period of time due to an illness or an injury, but are not permanently disabled. Consider

       Insurance  protection or to supplement any existing coverage. It includes benefits for loss due to acts of

       Long Term Care AFSPA has been sponsoring long term care plans since 1990 as we believe strongly that this 
       Planning   coverage can be a very important part of an individual’s portfolio. One plan does not fit all, 
                  so as long term care products have evolved, we enhanced our long term care offerings. Our

       Institutes of Aetna provides members access to infertility providers with proven outcomes through 
       Excellence™ (IOE) Aetna’s Institutes of Excellence™ (IOE) Infertility network.
       Infertility ProvidersProviders in our IOE Infertility network produce a higher live birth rate per cycle and 
                  transfer a lower number of embryos per cycle.  This equates to fewer multiple births, and 
                  therefore healthier mothers and babies.  To be part of the IOE network, providers must meet 
                  high medical standards and have a successful record of treatment. Aetna’s IOE Infertility 
                  network provides more comprehensive education and enables safe and effective care for 
                  better quality outcomes and lower medical costs.

      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 103 Non-FEHB benefits available to Plan members Section 5 
       FSAFEDS Paperless FSAFEDS, in partnership with the Foreign Service Benefit Plan, offers a Paperless 
       Reimbursement Reimbursement option allowing you to be reimbursed from your FSAFEDS health care 
       Option     account without submitting a claim.  When you receive benefits through the Foreign 
                  Service Benefit Plan, your out-of-pocket liability – the amount of money you paid to your 
                  provider – will be sent automatically to FSAFEDS for processing.  FSAFEDS will review 
                  your claims and reimburse you for any eligible out-of-pocket expenses – no need for a claim 
                  form or receipt (in most cases – check with the Plan for exceptions).  In many cases, you 
                  will receive your reimbursement before your provider’s bill is due. Reimbursement will be 
                  made directly from your FSAFEDS account to you via Electronic Funds Transfer. 
                  See Section 11 of this brochure, visit www.FSAFEDS.com, or call toll-free 877-FSAFEDS 
                  (372-3337) to learn more about how you can save money on your out-of-pocket health care 
                  expenses. 
                  Note: You must enroll in paperless reimbursement with FSAFEDS to take advantage of this 
                  option. 
                  Note: If you are enrolled in a Flexible Spending Account (FSA) and wellness incentives 
                  have been deposited into your wellness fund, you may not receive reimbursement for the 
                  same medical expense from both your wellness fund account and your FSA. If a medical 
                  expense is covered under both your wellness fund account and your FSA, you must use the 
                  funds in your wellness fund account first. Enrollees may receive reimbursements from their 
                  FSAs for medical expenses that are covered by both their wellness fund account and their 
                  FSA only after the funds in the wellness fund account have been exhausted. In order to 
                  receive reimbursement from your wellness fund account for qualified medical expenses, you 
                  must complete and sign a Wellness Incentive Claim Form certifying that you have not 
                  received reimbursement for the applicable qualified medical expense and that you will not 
                  seek such reimbursement under any other plan or arrangement. If you receive 
                  reimbursements from more than one plan or arrangement for the same qualified medical 
                  expense, the amount received in excess of the qualified medical expense may be taxable to 
                  you as income.

      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 104 Non-FEHB benefits available to Plan members Section 5 
         Section 6. General exclusions – services, drugs and supplies we do not cover 
      The exclusions in this Section apply to all benefits. There may be other exclusions and limitations listed in Section 5 of this 
      brochure. Although we may list a specific service as a benefit, we will not cover it unless we determine it is medically 
      necessary to prevent, diagnose, or treat your illness, disease, injury, or condition. The fact that a covered provider has 
      prescribed, recommended or approved a service or supply does not make it medically necessary or eligible for coverage 
      under this Plan. For information on obtaining precertification or  prior approval for services such as, but not limited 
      to: chemotherapy, radiology imaging procedures, radiation oncology, gender reassignment surgery, transplants, skilled 
      nursing facility admissions, mental health and substance misuse disorder treatment, and certain prescription drugs, see 
      Section 3, How you get care under Other services. 
      We do not cover the following: 
       Services, drugs, or supplies you receive while you are not enrolled in this Plan. 
       Services, drugs, or supplies that are not medically necessary. 
       Services, drugs, or supplies not required according to accepted standards of medical, dental, or psychiatric practice. 
       Experimental or investigational procedures, treatments, drugs or devices. 
       Services, drugs, or supplies related to clinical trials as follows: Extra care costs related to taking part in a clinical trial 
       such as additional tests that a patient may need as part of the trial, but not as part of the patient’s routine care. This Plan 
       does not cover these costs; and research costs related to conducting the clinical trial such as research physician and nurse 
       time, analysis of results, and clinical tests performed only for research purposes. These costs are generally covered by the 
       clinical trials. This Plan does not cover these costs. 
       Services, drugs, or supplies related to abortions, except when the life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus 
       were carried to term, or when the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest. 
       Services, drugs, or supplies related to the treatment of impotency, sexual dysfunction or sexual inadequacy. 
       Services, drugs, or supplies you receive from a provider or facility barred from the FEHB Program. 
       Any part of a provider’s fee or charge ordinarily due from you that has been waived. If a provider routinely waives (does 
       not require you to pay) a deductible, copayment or coinsurance, we will calculate the actual provider fee or charge by 
       reducing the fee or charge by the amount waived. 
       Charges which the enrollee or the Plan have no legal obligation to pay, such as excess charges for an annuitant 65 or 
       older who is not covered by Medicare Parts A and/or B (see Section 9), doctor's charges exceeding the amount specified 
       by the Department of Health and Human Services when benefits are payable under Medicare (limiting charge, see 
       Section 9), preventable medical errors ("Never Events") as defined by Medicare that Medicare states you are not liable 
       for, or State premium taxes however applied. 
       Services, drugs, or supplies you receive without charge while in active military service. 
       Services, drugs, or supplies for which no charge would be made if the covered individual had no health insurance 
       coverage. 
       Services and supplies not recommended or approved by a covered provider. 
       Services for cosmetic purposes. 
       Services, drugs, or supplies related to weight control or any treatment of obesity except as described in Sections 5(a), 
       Medical services and supplies and 5(f), Prescription drug benefits and except surgery for morbid obesity as described in 
       Section 5(b), Surgical and anesthesia services. 
       Services, drugs, or supplies furnished or billed by a noncovered facility, except that medically necessary prescription 
       drugs and physical, speech, and occupational therapy rendered by a qualified professional therapist on an outpatient basis 
       are covered, subject to Plan limits.

       children, brothers, or sisters by blood, marriage, or adoption.

       medical records inappropriately, the expenses may be covered 
       Bank fees including those associated with currency exchange 
       Custodial care 
       Mutually exclusive procedures.  These are procedures that typically are not provided to the same patient on the same 
       date of service

       described in Section 5(a), Medical services and supplies

             In most cases, providers and facilities file claims for you. Your physician or other health care professional 
             must file on the form CMS-1500, Health Insurance Claim Form. Your facility will file on the UB-04 form. 
             When you must file a claim – such as for out-of-network providers or when another group health plan is 
             primary – submit it on the CMS-1500 or a claim form that includes the information shown below. Overseas 
             claims do not need to be filed on a CMS-1500; however, the information below still is required to receive

                Patient’s name, date of birth, address, phone number and relationship to enrollee 
                Patient’s Plan identification number 
                Name, address, and tax identification number of the person or company providing the services or 
               supplies. We do not need the tax identification number for providers outside the United States.

                Diagnosis 
                Type of each service or supply

             Note: If you paid for the services, we may ask you for proof of payment in the form of your receipt of 
             payment or provider proof of payment stamp. 
             Note: Canceled checks, cash register receipts, or balance due statements are not acceptable substitutes for

             claims as described above through our secure Member Portal. 
             In addition: 
                Generally, you need to fill out only one claim form per year. You should fill out a claim form if you 
               submit a claim due to accidental injury, you have changed your address, or if the member’s other 
               insurance/Medicare status has changed. 
                If another health plan is your primary payor, you must send a copy of the explanation of benefits (EOB) 
               form you received from your primary payor (such as the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN)) with your 
               claim. 
                Bills for private duty nursing care must show that the nurse is a Registered Nurse (R.N.) or Licensed

               required on the previous page) and the dentist’s Federal Tax ID Number. We do not have separate dental 
               claim forms. 
     Post-service We will notify you of our decision within 30 days after we receive your post-service claim. If matters beyond 
     claims  our control require an extension of time, we may take up to an additional 15 days for review and we will 
     proceduresnotify you before the expiration of the original 30-day period. Our notice will include the circumstances 
             underlying the request for the extension and the date when a decision is expected. 
             If we need an extension because we have not received necessary information from you, our notice will 
             describe the specific information required and we will allow you up to 60 days from the receipt of the notice 
             to provide the information. 
             If you do not agree with our initial decision, you may ask us to review it by following the disputed claims 
             process detailed in Section 8 of this brochure. 
     Records Keep a separate record of the medical expenses of each covered family member as deductibles and 
             maximum allowances apply separately to each person.  Save copies of all medical bills, including those you 
             accumulate to satisfy a deductible. In most instances they will serve as evidence of your claim. 
             We will provide you with a record of expenses you submit and benefits we paid for each claim that you file 
             (explanation of benefits (EOB)).  You are responsible for keeping these.  We will not provide duplicate or 
             year-end statements. If you need duplicate copies, please refer to Section 5(h), Special features under Aetna 
             Navigator (Web based customer service).
     Deadline for Send us all of the documents for your claim as soon as possible.  You must submit the claim by December 31

     claim   administrative operations or legal incapacity, you must submit your claim as soon as reasonably possible. 
             We void uncashed reimbursement checks two years from the date they were issued. Once we pay benefits, 
             there is a three-year limitation on the reissuance of uncashed checks. 
     Overseas ClaimsThe Foreign Service Benefit Plan pays claims for providers outside the 50 United States at the same in-
             network coinsurance rate as in-network providers in the 50 United States, except in Guam which is part of 
             the Plan’s network and subject to in- and out-of-network benefits. 
             If you are posted outside the 50 United States and both the Medical and Health Program of the Department 
             of State – Bureau of Medical Services (MED) – and we cover you, submit claims to us as described below 
             or as directed by MED, through your Management Office. 
             If the Medical and Health Program of the Department of State does not cover you, you should submit claims 
             directly to us as described on the previous page. 
             You do not need to file overseas claims on CMS-1500 or UB-04 forms; however, the information 
             referenced below still is required to receive reimbursement.
             When filing a claim for services rendered by an overseas provider, bills and receipts should be itemized and 
             show:

             Note: Canceled checks, cash register receipts, or balance due statements are not acceptable substitutes for 
             itemized bills. Submissions of only a credit card or cash register receipt will result in a request for additional 
             information. In addition, the Plan cannot accept a claim from you as an e-mail attachment. You may submit 
             claims through our secure Member Portal as described on page 107. 
             Note: We will provide translation and currency conversion services for claims for overseas (foreign) 
             services. 
             Note: Members receiving services in countries under sanction by the Office of Foreign Assets Control 
             (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury may be requested to provide additional information. 
             We use the following methods to process your foreign claims:  
                We will translate your claim, if you do not provide a translation. 
                We will use the U.S. dollar exchange rate applicable on the date the service was incurred, if you do not 
               supply us with a currency exchange rate along with a paid receipt. 
               -   If you receive services from a provider who is part of our Direct Billing Arrangements, we will use the 
                exchange rate on the date the service was incurred if the provider does not supply us with a currency 
                exchange rate. 
               -   Generally, you do not pay a provider in our Direct Billing Arrangement. We must reimburse the 
                provider directly for any covered expenses. You are responsible, however, for any deductible and 
                coinsurance, which we do not reimburse. 
               -   If you have paid a direct billing provider prior to your claim submission, we request that you provide 
                us with a copy of your paid receipt along with the exchange rate you used to convert the currency. 
             Note: The Plan will validate exchange rates provided by you or a Direct Billing Arrangements provider for 
             accuracy. 
             We have special direct billing arrangements with hospitals in many countries, including China, Colombia, 
             France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Korea, Panama, Russia, Switzerland and Turkey.  In addition, 
             overseas Seventh-day Adventist Hospitals and Clinics participate in our special billing arrangement.  Please

     Notice  The Secretary of Health and Human Services has identified counties where at least 10 percent of the 
     Requirements population is literate only in certain non-English languages. The non-English languages meeting this 
             threshold in certain counties are Spanish, Chinese, Navajo and Tagalog. If you live in one of these counties, 
             we will provide language assistance in the applicable non-English language. You can request a copy of your 
             Explanation of Benefits (EOB) statement, related correspondence, oral language services (such as telephone 
             customer assistance), and help with filing claims and appeals (including external reviews) in the applicable 
             non-English language. The English versions of your EOBs and related correspondence will include 
             information in the non-English language about how to access language services in that non-English 
             language. 
              Any notice of an adverse benefit determination or correspondence from us confirming an adverse benefit 
             determination will include information sufficient to identify the claim involved (including the date of service, 
             the health care provider, and the claim amount, if applicable), and a statement describing the availability, 
             upon request, of the diagnosis and procedure codes and its corresponding meaning, and the treatment code 
             and its corresponding meaning).

                         Section 8. The disputed claims process 
       You may appeal directly to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) if we do not follow required claims processes. For 
       more information about situations in which you are entitled to immediately appeal to OPM, including additional 
       requirements not listed in Sections 3, 7 and 8 of this brochure, please visit www.AFSPA.org/FSBP. 
       Please follow this Federal Employees Health Benefits Program disputed claims process if you disagree with our decision on 
       your post-service claim (a claim where services, drugs or supplies have already been provided). In Section 3, If you disagree 
       with our pre-service claim decision, we describe the process you need to follow if you have a claim for services, referrals, 
       drugs or supplies that must have prior Plan approval, such as inpatient hospital admissions. 
       To help you prepare your appeal, you may arrange with us to review and copy, free of charge, all relevant materials and Plan 
       documents under our control relating to your claim, including those that involve any expert review(s) of your claim. To make 
       your request, please contact our Customer Service Department by writing Foreign Service Benefit Plan, 1620 L Street, NW, 
       Suite 800, Washington, DC 20036-5629 or through our secure Member Portal at www.myafspa.org (login to the Member 
       Portal with your username and password), or by calling 202-833-4910 (M-F 8:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. ET). 
       Our reconsideration will take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information submitted by you 
       relating to the claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted or considered in the initial benefit 
       determination. 
       When our initial decision is based (in whole or in part) on a medical judgment (i.e., medical necessity, experimental/
       investigational), we will consult with a health care professional who has appropriate training and experience in the field of 
       medicine involved in the medical judgment and who was not involved in making the initial decision. 
       Our reconsideration will not take into account the initial decision. The review will not be conducted by the same person, or 
       his/her subordinate, who made the initial decision. 
       We will not make our decisions regarding hiring, compensation, termination, promotion, or other similar matters with respect 
       to any individual (such as a claims adjudicator or medical expert) based upon the likelihood that the individual will support 
       the denial of benefits. 
        Step                         Description 
        1    Ask us in writing to reconsider our initial decision. You must:  
            a) Write to us within 6 months from the date of our decision; and 
            b) Send your request to us at: Foreign Service Benefit Plan, 1620 L Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, DC 
            20036-5629; and 
            c) Include a statement about why you believe our initial decision was wrong, based on specific benefit provisions 
            in this brochure; and 
            d) Include copies of documents that support your claim, such as physicians' letters, operative reports, bills, 
            medical records, and explanation of benefits (EOB) forms. 
            e) Include your email address (optional for member), if you would like to receive our decision via email. Please 
            note that by giving us your email, we may be able to provide our decision more quickly. 
            We will provide you, free of charge and in a timely manner, with any new or additional evidence considered, 
            relied upon, or generated by us or at our direction in connection with your claim and any new rationale for our 
            claim decision. We will provide you with this information sufficiently in advance of the date that we are required 
            to provide you with our reconsideration decision to allow you a reasonable opportunity to respond to us before 
            that date. However, our failure to provide you with new evidence or rationale in sufficient time to allow you to 
            timely respond shall not invalidate our decision on reconsideration. You may respond to that new evidence or 
            rationale at the OPM review stage described in step 4. 
        2   In the case of a post-service claim, we have 30 days from the date we receive your request to: 
            a) Pay the claim; or  
       2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 111                      Section 8 
            b) Write to you and maintain our denial; or 
            c) Ask you or your provider for more information.  
            You or your provider must send the information so that we receive it within 60 days of our request. We will then 
            decide within 30 more days. 
            If we do not receive the information within 60 days we will decide within 30 days of the date the information 
            was due. We will base our decision on the information we already have. We will write to you with our decision. 
        3   If you do not agree with our decision, you may ask OPM to review it. 
            You must write to OPM within: 
               90 days after the date of our letter upholding our initial decision; or  
               120 days after you first wrote to us – if we did not answer that request in some way within 30 days; or  
               120 days after we asked for additional information. 
            Write to OPM at: United States Office of Personnel Management, Healthcare and Insurance, Federal Employee 
            Insurance Operations, Health Insurance 2, 1900 E Street, NW, Washington, DC 20415-3620.  
            Send OPM the following information: 
               A statement about why you believe our decision was wrong, based on specific benefit provisions in this 
              brochure;  
               Copies of documents that support your claim, such as physicians' letters, operative reports, bills, medical 
              records, and explanation of benefits (EOB) forms;  
               Copies of all letters you sent to us about the claim;  
               Copies of all letters we sent to you about the claim;  
               Your daytime phone number and the best time to call; and  
               Your email address, if you would like to receive OPM’s decision via email. Please note that by providing 
              your email address, you may receive OPM’s decision more quickly. 
            Note: If you want OPM to review more than one claim, you must clearly identify which documents apply to 
            which claim. 
            Note: You are the only person who has a right to file a disputed claim with OPM. Parties acting as your 
            representative, such as medical providers, must include a copy of your specific written consent with the review 
            request. However, for urgent care claims, a health care professional with knowledge of your medical condition 
            may act as your authorized representative without your express consent. 
            Note: The above deadlines may be extended if you show that you were unable to meet the deadline because of 
            reasons beyond your control. 
        4   OPM will review your disputed claim request and will use the information it collects from you and us to decide 
            whether our decision is correct. OPM will send you a final decision within 60 days. There are no other 
            administrative appeals. 
            If you do not agree with OPM’s decision, your only recourse is to file a lawsuit. If you decide to sue, you must 
            file the suit against OPM in Federal court by December 31 of the third year after the year in which you received 
            the disputed services, drugs, or supplies or from the year in which you were denied precertification or prior 
            approval. This is the only deadline that may not be extended. 
            OPM may disclose the information it collects during the review process to support their disputed claim decision. 
            This information will become part of the court record. 
       2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 112                      Section 8 
          You may not file a lawsuit until you have completed the disputed claims process. Further, Federal law governs 
          your lawsuit, benefits, and payment of benefits. The Federal court will base its review on the record that was 
          before OPM when OPM decided to uphold or overturn our decision. You may recover only the amount of 
          benefits in dispute. 
      Note: If you have a serious or life threatening condition (one that may cause permanent loss of bodily functions or death if 
      not treated as soon as possible), and you did not indicate that your claim was a claim for urgent care, then call us at 
      202-833-4910. We will expedite our review (if we have not yet responded to your claim); or we will inform OPM so they can 
      quickly review your claim on appeal. You may call OPM’s Health Insurance 2 at 202-606-3818 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. 
      Eastern Time. 
      Please remember that we do not make decisions about Plan eligibility issues.  For example, we do not determine whether you 
      or a dependent is covered under this Plan.  You must raise eligibility issues with your Agency personnel/payroll office if you 
      are an employee, your retirement system if you are an annuitant or the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs if you are 
      receiving Workers' Compensation benefits.

      When you have You must tell us if you or a covered family member has coverage under any other group health 
      other health plan or has automobile insurance that pays health care expenses without regard to fault.  This is 
      coverage   called “double coverage”. 
                 When you have double coverage, one plan normally pays its benefits in full as the primary payor 
                 and the other plan pays a reduced benefit as the secondary payor.  We, like other insurers, 
                 determine which coverage is primary according to the National Association of Insurance 
                 Commissioners’ (NAIC) guidelines.  For more information on NAIC rules regarding the 
                 coordinating of benefits, visit our website at www.AFSPA.org/FSBP.  
                 When we are the primary payor, we will pay the benefits described in this brochure.  
                 When we are the secondary payor, we will determine our allowance.  You must send us your 
                 primary plan’s explanations of benefits (EOBs) if we ask for them.  After the primary plan pays, 
                 we will pay what is left of our allowance, up to the lesser of: 
                   Our benefits in full; or  
                   A reduced amount that, when added to the benefits payable by the primary plan, does not 
                  exceed 100% of covered expenses.  
                 We will not pay more than our allowance. The combined payments from both plans might not 
                 equal the entire amount billed by the provider. 
                 Please see Section 4, Your costs for covered services, for more information about how we pay

                 to disabled Veterans and their eligible dependents. If TRICARE or CHAMPVA and this Plan 
                 cover you, we pay first. See your TRICARE or CHAMPVA Health Benefits Advisor if you have

                 For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, contact your retirement office. If you 
                 later want to re-enroll in the FEHB Program, generally you may do so only at the next Open 
                 Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage under TRICARE or CHAMPVA.

                 Once OWCP or a similar agency pays its maximum benefits for your treatment, we will cover 
                 your care.

      injuries   If you receive (or are entitled to) a monetary recovery from any source as the result of an injury 
                 or illness, you are required to reimburse us out of that recovery for any and all of our benefits 
                 paid to diagnose and treat that illness or injury to the full extent of the benefits paid or provided. 
                 Additionally, if your representatives (heirs, estate, administrators, legal representatives, 
                 successors, or assignees) receive (or are entitled to) a monetary recovery from any source as a 
                 result of an injury or illness to you, they are required to reimburse us out of that recovery.  This 
                 is known as our reimbursement right. 
                 We may also, at our option, pursue recovery as successor to the rights of the enrollee or any 
                 covered family member who suffered an illness or injury, which includes the right to file suit 
                 and make claims in your name, and to obtain reimbursement directly from the responsible party, 
                 liability insurer, first party insurer, or benefit program. This is known as our subrogation right. 
                 Examples of situations to which our reimbursement and subrogation rights apply include, but are

                 or under any type of insurance or benefit program, including but not limited to: 
                   No-fault insurance and other insurance that pays without regard to fault, including personal 
                  injury protection benefits, regardless of any election made by you to treat those benefits as

                 Our reimbursement right applies even if the monetary recovery may not compensate you fully 
                 for all of the damages resulting from the injuries or illness. In other words, we are entitled to be 
                 reimbursed for those benefit payments even if you are not “made whole” for all of your damages 
                 by the compensation you receive. 
                 Our reimbursement right is not subject to reduction for attorney’s fees under the “common fund” 
                 doctrine. We are entitled to be reimbursed for 100% of the benefits we paid on account of the 
                 injuries or illness unless we agree in writing to accept a lesser amount. 
                 We enforce our reimbursement right by asserting a first priority lien against any and all 
                 recoveries you receive by court order or out-of-court settlement, insurance or benefit program 
                 claims, or otherwise, regardless of whether medical benefits are specifically designated in the 
                 recovery and without regard to how it is characterized (for example as “pain and suffering"), 
                 designated, or apportioned. Our subrogation or reimbursement interest shall be paid from the 
                 recovery before any of the rights of any other parties are paid.  
      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 115          Section 9 
                 You agree to cooperate with our enforcement of our reimbursement right by: 
                   Telling us promptly whenever you have filed a claim for compensation resulting from an 
                  accidental injury or illness and responding to our questionnaires; 
                   Pursuing recovery of our benefit payments from the third party or available insurance 
                  company; 
                   Accepting our lien for the full amount of our benefit payments; 
                   Signing our Reimbursement Agreement when requested to do so; 
                   Agreeing to assign any proceeds or rights to proceeds from third party claims or any 
                  insurance to us; 
                   Keeping us advised of the claim's status; 
                   Agreeing and authorizing us to communicate directly with any relevant insurance carrier 
                  regarding the claim related to your injury or illness; 
                   Advising us of any recoveries you obtain, whether by insurance claim, settlement or court 
                  order; and 
                   Agreeing that you or your legal representative will hold any funds from settlement or 
                  judgment in trust until you have verified our lien amount, and reimbursed us out of any 
                  recovery received to the full extent of our reimbursement right. 
                 You further agree to cooperate fully with us in the event we exercise our subrogation right. 
                 Failure to cooperate with these obligations may result in the temporary suspension of your 
                 benefits and/or offsetting of future benefits. 
                 For more information about this process, please call our Third Party Recovery Services unit at 
                 202-683-9140 or 855-661-7973 (toll free).  You also can email them at info@elgtprs.com. 
      When you have Some FEHB plans already cover some dental and vision services. When you are covered by 
      Federal Employees more than one vision/dental plan, coverage provided under your FEHB plan remains as your 
      Dental and Vision primary coverage. FEDVIP coverage pays secondary to that coverage. When you enroll in a 
      Insurance Plan dental and/or vision plan on BENEFEDS.com or by phone at 877-888-3337, (TTY 877-889- 
      (FEDVIP)   5680), you will be asked to provide information on your FEHB plan so that your plans can 
                 coordinate benefits. Providing your FEHB information may reduce your out-of-pocket cost.  
      Clinical trialsAn approved clinical trial includes a phase I, phase II, phase III, or phase IV clinical trial that is 
                 conducted in relation to the prevention, detection, or treatment of cancer or other life-threatening 
                 disease or condition and is either Federally funded; conducted under an investigational new drug 
                 application reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration; or is a drug trial that is exempt from 
                 the requirement of an investigational new drug application.   
                 If you are a participant in a clinical trial, this health plan will cover related care costs only as 
                 follows, if they are not provided by the clinical trial: 
                   Routine care costs – costs for routine services such as doctor visits, lab tests, X-rays and 
                  scans, and hospitalizations related to treating the patient’s condition, whether the patient is in 
                  a clinical trial or is receiving standard therapy. These costs are covered by this Plan. 
                   Extra care costs – costs related to taking part in a clinical trial such as additional tests that a 
                  patient may need as part of the trial, but not as part of the patient’s routine care. This Plan 
                  does not cover these costs. 
                   Research costs – costs related to conducting the clinical trial such as research physician and 
                  nurse time, analysis of results, and clinical tests performed only for research purposes are 
                  considered research costs. These costs are generally covered by the clinical trials. This Plan 
                  does not cover these costs.

      Medicare
         What is Medicare is a health insurance program for: 
        Medicare?   People 65 years of age or older 
                    Some people with disabilities under 65 years of age 
                    People with End-Stage Renal Disease (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a 
                   transplant) 
                  Medicare has four parts: 
                    Part A (Hospital Insurance). Most people do not have to pay for Part A. If you or your 
                   spouse worked for at least 10 years in Medicare-covered employment, you should be able 
                   to qualify for premium-free Part A insurance. (If you were a Federal employee at any time 
                   both before and during January 1983, you will receive credit for your Federal employment 
                   before January 1983.) Otherwise, if you are age 65 or older, you may be able to buy it. 
                   Contact 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227), (TTY: 877-486-2048) for more information. 
                    Part B (Medical Insurance). Most people pay monthly for Part B. Generally, Part B 
                   premiums are withheld from your monthly Social Security check or your retirement 
                   check. 
                    Part C (Medicare Advantage). You can enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan to get your 
                   Medicare benefits. Please review the information on coordinating benefits with Medicare 
                   Advantage plans on page 120. 
                    Part D (Medicare prescription drug coverage). There is a monthly premium for Part D 
                   coverage. Before enrolling in Medicare Part D, please review the important disclosure 
                   notice from us about the FEHB prescription drug coverage and Medicare. The notice is on 
                   the first inside page of this brochure. For people with limited income and resources, extra 
                   help in paying for a Medicare prescription drug plan is available. For more information 
                   about this extra help, visit the Social Security Administration online at www.
                   socialsecurity.gov, or call them at 800-772-1213 (TTY: 800-325-0778).   
         Should I enroll in The decision to enroll in Medicare is yours. We encourage you to apply for Medicare benefits 
        Medicare? 3 months before you turn age 65. It’s easy. Just call the Social Security Administration toll-
                  free number 800-772-1213 (TTY: 800-325-0778) to set up an appointment to apply. If you do 
                  not apply for one or more Parts of Medicare, you can still be covered under the FEHB 
                  Program. 
                  If you can get premium-free Part A coverage, we advise you to enroll in it. Most Federal 
                  employees and annuitants are entitled to Medicare Part A at age 65 without cost.  
                  When you don’t have to pay premiums for Medicare Part A, it makes good sense to obtain the 
                  coverage. It can reduce your out-of-pocket expenses as well as costs to the FEHB, which can 
                  help keep FEHB premiums down. 
                  Everyone is charged a premium for Medicare Part B coverage. The Social Security 
                  Administration can provide you with premium and benefit information. Review the 
                  information and decide if it makes sense for you to buy the Medicare Part B coverage.  If you 
                  do not sign up for Medicare Part B when you are first eligible, you may be charged a 
                  Medicare Part B late enrollment penalty of a 10% increase in premium for every 12 months 
                  you are not enrolled.  If you didn't take Part B at age 65 because you were covered under 
                  FEHB as an active employee (or you were covered under your spouse's group health 
                  insurance plan and he/she was an active employee), you may sign up for Part B (generally 
                  without an increased premium) within 8 months from the time you or your spouse stop 
                  working or are no longer covered by the group plan.  You also can sign up at any time while 
                  you are covered by the group plan.  
      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 117          Section 9 
                  If you are eligible for Medicare, you may have choices in how you get your health care. 
                  Medicare Advantage is the term used to describe the various private health plan choices 
                  available to Medicare beneficiaries. The information in the next few pages shows how we 
                  coordinate benefits with Medicare, depending on whether you are in the Original Medicare 
                  Plan or a private Medicare Advantage plan. 
                  Please refer to When you are age 65 or over and do not have Medicare in this section for 
                  information about how we provide benefits when you are age 65 or older and do not 
                  have Medicare.
         The Original The Original Medicare Plan (Original Medicare) is available everywhere in the United States. 
        Medicare Plan It is the way everyone used to get Medicare benefits and is the way most people get their 
        (Part A or Part B)Medicare Part A and Part B benefits now. You may go to any doctor, specialist, or hospital that 
                  accepts Medicare. The Original Medicare Plan pays its share and you pay your share. 
                  All physicians and other providers are required by law to file claims directly to Medicare for 
                  members with Medicare Part B, when Medicare is primary.  This is true whether or not they 
                  accept Medicare. 
                  When you are enrolled in Original Medicare along with this Plan, you still need to follow the 
                  rules in this brochure for us to cover your care. We do not require precertification, 
                  preauthorization, or concurrent review when Medicare Part A and/or Part B is the primary 
                  payor. Precertification, preauthorization, and concurrent review are required, however, when 
                  Medicare stops paying benefits for any reason. We do not require prior authorization for the 
                  purchase of certain prescription drugs when Medicare Part B or Part D is the primary payor 
                  for the drugs or you are outside the 50 United States and purchase them from a retail 
                  pharmacy outside the 50 United States. However, when Medicare stops paying benefits for 
                  any reason, you must follow our precertification, preauthorization, prior authorization, and 
                  concurrent review procedures. 
                  We limit our payment to an amount that supplements the benefits that Medicare would pay 
                  under Medicare Part A (Hospital insurance) and Medicare Part B (Medical insurance), 
                  regardless of whether Medicare pays. Note: We pay our regular benefits for emergency 
                  services to an institutional provider, such as a hospital that does not participate with Medicare 
                  and is not reimbursed by Medicare. 
                  Claims process when you have the Original Medicare Plan – Send us a copy of your 
                  Medicare Card when we are secondary to Medicare. We need this information in order to 
                  start electronic crossover of your claims. Electronic crossover is a process that assures, in 
                  most cases, you do not have to file a claim when Medicare is primary. Call us at 
                  202-833-4910 or contact us through our secure Member Portal at www.myafspa.org.  Login to

                  electronically filed or you have questions about the process described on the next page. You 
                  probably will not need to file a claim form when you have both our Plan and the Original 
                  Medicare Plan. 
                  When we are the primary payor, we process the claim first. 
                  When Original Medicare is the primary payor, Medicare processes your claim first. In most 
                  cases, we will coordinate your claim automatically and provide secondary benefits for 
                  covered charges. There are exceptions: 
                    If you have not sent us a copy of your Medicare Card as stated above, you will need to 
                   send us your claims and Medicare Summary Notices (MSNs) until you have sent us a 
                   copy of your Medicare Card and we have had time to set up electronic crossover. 
                    If Medicare rejects your claim completely, send us your claim and your MSN. You must 
                   send them in order for us to begin processing your claim.

                   them to us in order for us to continue processing your claim.

                   accidents in Section 5(d).
                   -   If you are enrolled in Medicare Part B, we will waive the deductible, coinsurance and 
                    copay.

      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 119          Section 9 
         Private contract If you are enrolled in Medicare Part B, a physician may ask you to sign a private contract 
        with your agreeing that you can be billed directly for services ordinarily covered by Original Medicare, 
        physician that is, the physician may have opted out of the entire Medicare Program. Should you sign an 
                  agreement, neither you nor the physician may bill Medicare. Medicare will not pay any 
                  portion of the charges and we will not increase our payment. We will limit our payment to the 
                  coordinated amount we would have paid after Original Medicare’s payment. You may be 
                  responsible for paying the difference between the billed amount and the amount we paid. 
                  If the physician did not inform you of his/her “Opt Out” status or did not ask you to sign a 
                  private contract, we will process your initial claim for that physician using our regular in-
                  network/out-of-network benefit coinsurance. We will inform you and your physician in a

                  services from the physician, you will be responsible for paying the difference between the 
                  billed amount and the amount we paid as described above. 
         Medicare If you are eligible for Medicare, you may choose to enroll in and get your Medicare benefits 
        Advantage from a Medicare Advantage plan. These are private health care choices (like HMOs and 
        (Part C)  regional PPOs) in some areas of the country. 
                  To learn more about Medicare Advantage plans, contact Medicare at 800-MEDICARE 
                  (800-633-4227), (TTY: 877-486-2048) or at their website, www.medicare.gov. 
                  If you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, the following options are available to you: 
                  This Plan and another plan’s Medicare Advantage plan: You may enroll in another plan’s 
                  Medicare Advantage plan and also remain enrolled in our FEHB Plan. We will still provide 
                  benefits when your Medicare Advantage plan is primary, even out of the Medicare Advantage 
                  plan’s network and/or service area.  However, we will not waive any of our copayments, 
                  coinsurance, or deductibles. If you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan, tell us. We will need 
                  to know whether you are in the Original Medicare Plan or in a Medicare Advantage plan so 
                  we can correctly coordinate benefits with Medicare. 
                  Suspended FEHB coverage to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan: If you are an 
                  annuitant or former spouse, you can suspend your FEHB coverage to enroll in a Medicare 
                  Advantage plan, eliminating your FEHB premium. (OPM does not contribute to your 
                  Medicare Advantage plan premium.) For information on suspending your FEHB enrollment, 
                  contact your retirement office. If you later want to re-enroll in the FEHB Program, generally 
                  you may do so only at the next Open Season unless you involuntarily lose coverage or move 
                  out of the Medicare Advantage plan’s service area.

      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 120          Section 9 
      Medicare always makes the final determination as to whether they are the primary payor.  The following chart illustrates 
      whether Medicare or this Plan should be the primary payor for you according to your employment status and other factors 
      determined by Medicare.  It is critical that you tell us if you or a covered family member has Medicare coverage so we can 
      administer these requirements correctly. (Having coverage under more than two health plans may change the order of 
      benefits determined on this chart.)

      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 121          Section 9 
      Generally, this Plan is primary if you receive services or incur charges outside the 50 United States (except Guam). However, 
      in certain limited situations, Medicare may be primary for certain types of health care services you receive. 
      See Medicare publication 11037 at www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/11037-Medicare-Coverage-Outside-United-Stat.pdf for 
      details. 
      When you are age 65 or over and do not have Medicare
      Under the FEHB law, we must limit our payments for inpatient hospital care and physician care to those payments you would 
      be entitled to if you had Medicare. Your physician and hospital must follow Medicare rules and cannot bill you for more than 
      they could bill you if you had Medicare.  You and the FEHB benefit from these payment limits. Outpatient hospital care and 
      non-physician based care are not covered by this law; regular Plan benefits apply.  The following chart has more information 
      about the limits. 
      If you:
       are age 65 or over; and 
       do not have Medicare Part A, Part B, or both; and 
       have this Plan as an annuitant or as a former spouse, or as a family member of an annuitant or former spouse; and 
       are not employed in a position that gives FEHB coverage.  (Your employing office can tell you if this applies.) 
      Then, for your inpatient hospital care:
       The law requires us to base our payment on an amount - the "equivalent Medicare amount" - set by Medicare’s rules for 
       what Medicare would pay, not on the actual charge. 
       You are responsible for your applicable deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments under this Plan. 
       You are not responsible for any charges greater than the "equivalent Medicare amount"; we will show that amount on the 
       explanation of benefits (EOB) form that we send you. 
       The law prohibits a hospital from collecting more than the “equivalent Medicare amount”. 
      And, for your physician care, the law requires us to base our payment and your coinsurance or copayment on: 
       an amount set by Medicare and called the "Medicare approved amount," or 
       the actual charge if it is lower than the "Medicare approved amount". 
      If your physician:        Then you are responsible for:

      Opts-out of Medicare via private contract your deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, and any 
                                balance your physician charges 
      It is generally to your financial advantage to use a physician who participates with Medicare.  Such physicians are permitted 
      to collect only up to the Medicare approved amount. 
      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 122          Section 9 
      Physicians Who Opt-Out of Medicare
      A physician may have opted-out of Medicare and may or may not ask you to sign a private contract agreeing that you can be 
      billed directly for services ordinarily covered by Original Medicare. This is different than a non-participating doctor, and we 
      recommend you ask your physician if he or she has opted-out of Medicare. Should you visit an opt-out physician, the 
      physician will not be limited to 115% of the Medicare approved amount. You may be responsible for paying the difference 
      between the billed amount and our regular in-network/out-of-network benefits. 
      Our explanation of benefits (EOB) form will tell you how much the physician or hospital can collect from you.  If your 
      physician or hospital tries to collect more than allowed by law, ask the physician or hospital to reduce the charges.  If you 
      have paid more than allowed, ask for a refund.  If you need further assistance, call us. 
      When you have the We limit our payment to an amount that supplements the benefits that Medicare would pay 
      Original Medicare under Medicare Part A (Hospital insurance) and Medicare Part B (Medical insurance), 
      Plan (Part A, Part B, regardless of whether Medicare pays.  Note:  We pay our regular benefits for emergency 
      or both)    services to an institutional provider, such as a hospital, that does not participate with Medicare 
                  and is not reimbursed by Medicare.  
                  We use the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Medicare-equivalent Remittance Advice 
                  (MRA) when the statement is submitted to determine our payment for covered services 
                  provided to you if Medicare is primary, when Medicare does not pay the VA facility. 
                  If you are covered by Medicare Part B and it is primary, your out-of-pocket costs for services 
                  that both Medicare Part B and we cover depend on whether your physician accepts Medicare 
                  assignment for the claim. 
                  If your physician accepts Medicare assignment, then you pay nothing for covered charges. 
                  If your physician does not accept Medicare assignment, then you pay nothing because we 
                  supplement Medicare's payment up to the “limiting charge”. 
                  It is important to know that a physician who does not accept Medicare assignment may not 
                  bill you for more than 115% of the amount Medicare bases its payment on, called the 
                  “limiting charge.”  The Medicare Summary Notice (MSN) that Medicare will send you will 
                  have more information about the limiting charge.  If your physician tries to collect more than 
                  allowed by law, ask the physician to reduce the charges.  If the physician does not, report the 
                  physician to the Medicare carrier that sent you the MSN form. Call us if you need further 
                  assistance. 
                  Please see this section, The Original Medicare Plan (Part A or Part B), for more information 
                  about how we coordinate benefits with Medicare.

               Section 10. Definitions of terms we use in this brochure 
      Admission   The period from entry (admission) into a hospital or other covered facility until discharge. In 
                  counting days of inpatient care, we count the date of entry and the date of discharge as the 
                  same day. 
      Assignment  You authorize us to issue payment of benefits directly to the provider of services. The Plan 
                  reserves the right to pay the member directly for all covered services. 
      Calendar yearJanuary 1 through December 31 of the same year. For new enrollees, the calendar year begins 
                  on the effective date of their enrollment and ends on December 31 of the same year. 
      Cardiac rehabilitationA comprehensive exercise, education, and behavioral modification program designed to 
                  improve the physical and emotional condition of patients with heart disease.  Heart attack 
                  survivors, bypass and angioplasty patients, cardiac valvular surgery patients, and individuals 
                  with angina, congestive heart failure, and heart transplants are all candidates for a cardiac 
                  rehabilitation program.  Cardiac rehabilitation is prescribed to control symptoms, improve 
                  exercise tolerance, and improve the overall quality of life in these patients. 
      Clinical trials cost An approved clinical trial includes a phase I, phase II, phase III, or phase IV clinical trial that 
      categories  is conducted in relation to the prevention, detection, or treatment of cancer or other life-
                  threatening disease or condition, and is either Federally-funded; conducted under an 
                  investigational new drug application reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); 
                  or is a drug trial that is exempt from the requirement of an investigational new drug 
                  application. 
                  If you are a participant in a clinical trial, this health Plan will cover related care costs as 
                  follows, if they are not provided by the clinical trial: 
                    Routine care costs – costs for routine services such as doctor visits, lab tests, X-rays and 
                   scans, and hospitalizations related to treating the patient’s condition whether the patient is 
                   in a clinical trial or is receiving standard therapy. These costs are covered by this Plan. 
                    Extra care costs – costs related to taking part in a clinical trial such as additional tests that 
                   a patient may need as part of the trial, but not as part of the patient’s routine care. This 
                   Plan does not cover these costs. 
                    Research costs – costs related to conducting the clinical trial such as research physician 
                   and nurse time, analysis of results, and clinical tests performed only for research purposes. 
                   This Plan does not cover these costs. 
      Coinsurance The percentage of our allowance that you must pay for your care. You also may be 
                  responsible for additional amounts. See Section 4, Coinsurance. 
      Copayment   A fixed amount of money you pay to the provider when you receive covered services. See 
                  Section 4, Copayment. 
      Cost-SharingCost-sharing is the general term used to refer to your out-of-pocket costs (e.g., deductible, 
                  coinsurance, and copayments) for the covered care you receive. 
      Covered servicesServices we provide benefits for, as described in this brochure. 
      Custodial careTreatment or services, regardless of who recommends them or where they are provided, that a 
                  person not medically skilled could render safely and reasonably, or that help you mainly with

      Group health Health care coverage that you are eligible for because of employment, membership in, or 
      coverage    connection with, a particular organization or group that provides payment for any health care 
                  services or supplies, or that pays a specific amount for each day or period of hospitalization if 
                  the specified amount exceeds $200 per day, including extension of any of these benefits 
                  through COBRA. 
      Health care A physician or other health care professional licensed, accredited, or certified to perform 
      professionalspecified health services consistent with state law. 
      Hospital stayAn admission (or series of admissions separated by less than 60 days) to a hospital as an 
                  inpatient for any illness or injury. You start a new hospital stay when: 
                  1. The admission is for a cause unrelated to the previous admission; 
                  2. An employee returns to work for at least one day before the next admission; or 
                  3. The hospital stays are separated by at least 60 days for a dependent or retiree. 
      Intensive day Outpatient treatment of mental conditions or substance misuse disorder rendered at and billed 
      treatment   by a facility that meets the definition of a hospital. Treatment program must be established 
                  which consists of individual or group psychotherapy and/or psychological testing. 
      Medical FoodsThe term medical food, as defined in Section 5(b) of the Orphan Drug Act (21 U.S.C. 360ee 
                  (b) (3)), is “a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered enterally under the 
                  supervision of a physician and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a 
                  disease or condition for which distinctive nutritional requirements, based on recognized 
                  scientific principles, are established by medical evaluation.” In general, to be considered a 
                  medical food, a product must, at a minimum, meet the following criteria: the product must be 
                  a food for oral or tube feeding; the product must be labeled for the dietary management of a 
                  specific medical disorder, disease, or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional 
                  requirements; and the product must be intended to be used under medical supervision. 
      Medically necessaryServices, drugs, supplies, or equipment provided by a hospital or covered provider of the 
                  health care services that we determine: 
                  1. Are appropriate to diagnose or treat your condition, illness, or injury;  
                  2. Are consistent with standards of good medical practice in the United States;  
                  3. Are not primarily for your, a family member’s, or a provider’s personal comfort or 
                   convenience;  
                  4. Are not a part of or associated with your scholastic education or vocational training; and  
                  5. In the case of inpatient care, cannot be provided safely on an outpatient basis.  
                  The fact that a covered provider has prescribed, recommended, or approved a service, 
                  supply, drug, or equipment does not, in itself, make it medically necessary.
      Mental health Conditions and diseases listed in the most recent edition of the International Classification of

      Observation CareObservation care is a well-defined set of specific, clinically appropriate services, which 
                  include ongoing short term treatment, assessment, and reassessment, that are provided while a 
                  decision is being made regarding whether a patient will require further treatment as a hospital 
                  inpatient or whether a patient will be able to be discharged from the hospital. Observation 
                  services are commonly ordered for a patient who presents to the emergency room department 
                  and who then requires a significant period of treatment or monitoring in order to make a 
                  decision regarding their inpatient admission or discharge. Some hospitals will bill for 
                  observation room status (hourly) and hospital incidental services. See pages 60 and 61 for 
                  more information.  
                  This Plan uses National Standardized Criteria Sets and other nationally recognized clinical 
                  guidelines and resources in making determinations to evaluate the appropriateness of 
                  observation care services. 
      Plan allowanceThe amount we use to determine our payment and your coinsurance for covered services. Fee-
                  for-service plans determine their allowances in different ways. We determine our allowance as 
                  follows:  
                  In-network Providers (includes Guam) – Our Plan allowance is a negotiated amount 
                  between the Plan and the provider. We base our coinsurance on this negotiated amount, and 
                  the provider has agreed to accept the negotiated amount as full payment for any covered 
                  services rendered. This applies to all benefits in Section 5 of this brochure. 
                  Out-of-network Providers (includes Guam) – Our Plan allowance is the lesser of: (1) the 
                  provider’s billed charge; or (2) the Plan’s out-of-network fee schedule amount. The Plan’s 
                  out-of-network fee schedule amount is equal to the 90th percentile amount for the charges 
                  listed in the Prevailing Healthcare Charges System, or the Medicare Data Resources System 
                  administered by Fair Health, Inc., if such a charge does not exist for the service or supply. The 
                  out-of-network fee schedule amounts vary by geographic area in which services are furnished. 
                  We base our coinsurance on this out-of-network fee schedule amount. This applies to all 
                  benefits in Section 5 of this brochure. For urine drug testing services, the out-of-network 
                  allowance is the maximum Medicare allowance for such services. 
                  For certain services, exceptions may exist to the use of the out-of-network fee schedule to 
                  determine the Plan’s allowance for out-of-network providers, including, but not limited to, the 
                  use of Medicare fee schedule amounts. For claims governed by the Omnibus Budget 
                  Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1990 and 1993, the Plan allowance will be based on Medicare 
                  allowable amounts as is required by law. For claims where the Plan is the secondary payer to 
                  Medicare (Medicare COB situations), the Plan allowance is the Medicare allowable charge. 
                  Other Participating Providers (includes Guam) – Our Plan allowance is the amount that 
                  the provider has negotiated and agreed to accept for the services and/or supplies. Benefits will 
                  be paid at out-of-network benefit levels, subject to any applicable deductibles, coinsurance, 
                  and copayments. This applies to all benefits in Section 5 of this brochure. 
                  Providers outside the 50 United States  (does not include Guam) – We generally do not 
                  reduce claims from providers outside the 50 United States to a Plan allowance, that is, our 
                  Plan allowance is the amount billed by the provider or as part of our Direct Billing 
                  Arrangements.  However, we reserve the right to request information from you or your 
                  provider that will enable us to determine medical necessity or an allowance on charges that 
                  we deem to be excessive.  Our Plan allowance for air ambulance transport that initiates 
                  outside the 50 United States to the nearest medical facility equipped to handle your medical 
                  condition will be based on criteria provided to us from On Call International.   
                  For more information, see Section 4, Differences between our allowance and the bill. 
      Post-service claimsAny claims that are not pre-service claims. In other words, post-service claims are those 
                  claims where treatment has been performed and the claims have been sent to us in order to 
                  apply for benefits. 
      2018 Foreign Service Benefit Plan 127          Section 10 
      Pre-service claimsThose claims (1) that require precertification, preauthorization, concurrent review, or prior 
                  approval and (2) where failure to obtain precertification, preauthorization, concurrent review, 
                  or prior approval results in a reduction of benefits. 
      Providers outside the We consider treatment or services rendered by providers not located in the 50 United States 
      50 United States including the District of Columbia and Guam to be outside the 50 United States. 
      Routine preventive We cover preventive services, counseling, screenings and vaccinations recommended under 
      services and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). A 
      immunizationscomplete list of preventive care services, recommended under the USPSTF is available online

                  If our preventive services, counseling and screenings benefits are more generous than the 
                  ACA or USPSTF, we pay under the appropriate benefit without cost sharing when delivered 
                  by an in-network provider (including Guam) or provider outside the 50 United States.

      Urgent care claims A claim for medical care or treatment is an urgent care claim if waiting for the regular time 
                  limit for non-urgent care claims could have one of the following impacts: 
                    Waiting could seriously jeopardize your life or health;  
                    Waiting could seriously jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function; or  
                    In the opinion of a physician with knowledge of your medical condition, waiting would 
                   subject you to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or 
                   treatment that is the subject of the claim.  
                  Urgent care claims usually involve pre-service claims and not post-service claims.  We will 
                  judge whether a claim is an urgent care claim by applying the judgment of a prudent 
                  layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine. If you believe your 
                  claim qualifies as an urgent care claim, please contact the Plan through our Customer Service 
                  Department at the Foreign Service Benefit Plan, 1620 L Street, NW, Suite 800, Washington, 
                  DC 20036-5629, by phone at 202-833-4910 (M-F 8:30 a.m. - 5:30 p.m. ET), or e-mail

                  that your claim is an urgent care claim by providing evidence that a physician with knowledge 
                  of your medical condition has determined that your claim involves urgent care.

                     Section 11. Other Federal Programs 
   Please note, the following programs are not part of your FEHB benefits. They are separate Federal programs that complement your FEHB 
   benefits and can potentially reduce your annual out-of-pocket expenses. These programs are offered independent of the FEHB Program and 
   require you to enroll separately with no Government contribution. 
   Important information First, the Federal Flexible Spending Account Program, also known as FSAFEDS, lets you set aside pre-tax 
   about four Federal money from your salary to reimburse you for eligible dependent care and/or health care expenses. You pay 
   programs that less in taxes so you save money. Participating employees save an average of about 30% on products and 
   complement the FEHB services they routinely pay for out-of-pocket.  
   Program     Second, the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program (FEDVIP) provides 
               comprehensive dental and vision insurance at competitive group rates. There are several plans from which to 
               choose. Under FEDVIP you may choose self only, self plus one, or self and family coverage for yourself and 
               any eligible dependents. 
               Third, the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP) can help cover long term care costs, 
               which are not covered under the FEHB Program. 
               Fourth, the Federal Employees’ Group Life Insurance Program (FEGLI) can help protect your family 
               from burdensome funeral costs and the unexpected loss of your income. 
   The Federal Flexible Spending Account Program – FSAFEDS
   What is an FSA?It is an account where you contribute money from your salary BEFORE taxes are withheld, then incur 
               eligible expenses and get reimbursed. You pay less in taxes so you save money. Annuitants are not eligible 
               to enroll.
               There are three types of FSAs offered by FSAFEDS.  Each type has a minimum annual election of $100.  The 
               maximum annual election for a health care flexible spending account (HCFSA) or a limited expense health 
               care spending account (LEX HCFSA) is $2,600 per person. The maximum annual election for a dependent 
               care flexible spending account (DCFSA) is $5,000 per household. 
                 Health Care FSA (HCFSA) – Reimburses you for eligible out-of-pocket health care expenses (such as 
                copayments, deductibles, physician prescribed over-the-counter drugs and medications, vision and 
                dental expenses, and much more) for you and your tax dependents, including adult children (through the 
                end of the calendar year in which they turn 26). 
                FSAFEDS offers paperless reimbursement for your HCFSA through a number of FEHB and FEDVIP 
                plans. This means that when you or your provider files claims with your FEHB or FEDVIP plan, 
                FSAFEDS will automatically reimburse your eligible out-of-pocket expenses based on the claim 
                information it receives from your plan. 
                 Limited Expense Health Care FSA (LEX HCFSA) – Designed for employees enrolled in or covered by a 
                High Deductible Health Plan with a Health Savings Account. Eligible expenses are limited to out-of-
                pocket dental and vision care expenses for you and your tax dependents including adult children (through 
                the end of the calendar year in which they turn 26). 
                 Dependent Care FSA (DCFSA) – Reimburses you for eligible non-medical day care expenses for your 
                children under age 13 and/or for any person you claim as a dependent on your Federal Income Tax return 
                who is mentally or physically incapable of self-care. You (and your spouse if married) must be working, 
                looking for work (income must be earned during the year), or attending school full-time to be eligible for 
                a DCFSA. 
                 If you are a new or newly eligible employee you have 60 days from your hire date to enroll in an HCFSA 
                or LEX HCFSA and/or DCFSA, but you must enroll before October 1. If you are hired or become eligible 
                on or after October 1 you must wait and enroll during the Federal Benefits Open Season held each fall.
