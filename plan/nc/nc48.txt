    80/20 PLAN (PPO) BENEFITS BOOKLET 
    Welcome to the State Health Plan’s 80/20 PPO Plan, also referred to in this benefits booklet simply as your health benefit 
    plan, or the PPO Plan. Your health benefit plan is offered under a Blue Options Plan administered by Blue Cross and Blue 
    Shield of North Carolina (BCBSNC). 
    Please read this benefits booklet carefully so that you will understand your benefits. Your doctor or medical 
    professional is not responsible for explaining your benefits to you.  
    The State Health Plan has contracted with BCBSNC to use its Blue Options network. As a member of the PPO Plan, you 
    will enjoy quality health care from the Blue Options network of health care providers and easy access to specialists. Blue 
    Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina provides administrative services only and does not assume any financial risk or 
    obligation with respect to claims. You also have the freedom to choose health care providers who do not participate in the 
    Blue Options network. 
    You may receive, upon request, information about your health benefit plan, its services and doctors, including this 
    benefits booklet with a benefit summary, and a directory of in-network providers. 
    If any information in this booklet conflicts with North Carolina state law or it conflicts with medical policies adopted 
    under your health benefit plan, North Carolina law will prevail, followed by medical policies. If any of the Blue Cross and 
    Blue Shield of North Carolina medical policies conflict with the State Health Plan medical policies, the State Health Plan 
    medical policies will be applied. The availability of benefits is described in this booklet and member benefit language 
    should be reviewed before applying the terms of any medical policy.  
    The benefit plan described in this booklet is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
    (HIPAA). A summary of benefits, conditions, limitations and exclusions is set forth in this benefits booklet for easy 
    reference. 
    The information contained in this booklet is supported by medical policies which are used as guides to make coverage 
    determinations. For specific detailed information, or medical policies, please call Customer Service at 888-234-2416, or 
    visit the State Health Plan website at www.shpnc.org
                          . To obtain a copy of the General Statutes visit the North Carolina

                      Understanding Your State Health Plan Coverage
     UNDERSTANDING YOUR STATE HEALTH PLAN COVERAGE 
     This benefit booklet provides important information about your benefits and can help you understand how to maximize 
     them. To help you become familiar with some common insurance terms concerning what you may owe after visiting your 
     Provider, see the chart below: 
      Copayment    The fixed-dollar amount that is due and payable by the member at the time a covered service is 
                   provided. Copayments are not credited to the deductible; however, they are credited to the out-of-
                   pocket limit. See “Summary of Benefits” for your specific copayment amount. 
      Deductible   The dollar amount you must incur for covered services in a benefit period before benefits are 
                   payable under the Plan. The deductible does not include coinsurance, charges in excess of the 
                   allowed amount, amounts exceeding any maximum, or expenses for non-covered expenses. This 
                   plan has an embedded deductible which means you have an individual deductible and if 
                   dependents are covered, you also have a combined family deductible. You must meet your 
                   individual deductible before benefits are payable under the Plan. Once the family deductible is 
                   met, it is met for all covered family members. Amounts applied to your out-of-network deductible 
                   are credited to your in-network deductible. Amounts applied to your in-network deductible are 
                   not credited to your out-of-network deductible. Copayments are not credited to the benefit period 
                   deductible. See “Summary of Benefits” for your specific deductible amounts. 
      Coinsurance  Your share of the cost of a covered service, after you have met your benefit period deductible. 
                   This is stated as a percentage of the allowed amount. The coinsurance percentage shown in 
                   “Summary of Benefits” is the portion the member pays. 
      Out-of-Pocket Limit The out-of-pocket limit is the dollar amount you pay for covered services in a benefit period 
                   before the Plan pays 100%. Your out-of-pocket limit is determined by your type of coverage. The 
                   individual out-of-pocket limit applies to each individual covered by the Plan. If one or more 
                   dependents are covered under the Plan, all covered family members contribute to the same family 
                   out-of-pocket limit. When either the family in-network or out-of-network out-of-pocket limit is 
                   met, the family out-of-pocket limit is met for all covered family members. Coinsurance, 
                   copayments and deductibles, are included in the out-of-pocket limit. Non-covered services and 
                   amounts over allowed amounts or UCR (usual, customary and reasonable amounts) are not 
                   included in the out-of-pocket limit. Charges for prescription medications do not apply to the 
                   medical out-of-pocket limit but apply to the benefit period total out-of-pocket limit. Amounts 
                   applied to your out-of-network coinsurance are credited to your in-network coinsurance; 
                   however, amounts applied to your in-network coinsurance are not credited to your out-of-network 
                   coinsurance. For out-of-network services, members are responsible for the difference between the 
                   allowed amount and the total billed amount even after the out-of-pocket limit has been met, 
                   except for emergency room services. 
     Please note: The deductible and total out-of-pocket limit amounts listed in the “Summary of Benefits” may be revised 
     each year in accordance with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rulings. 
     If you are trying to determine whether coverage will be provided for a specific service, you may want to review all of the 
     following: 
     •  “Summary of Benefits" to get an overview of your specific benefits, such as deductible, coinsurance, copayments and 
       maximum amounts 
     •  “Covered Services" to get more detailed information on what is covered and what is excluded from coverage 
     •   “What Is Not Covered?" to see general exclusions from coverage. 
     •  “Utilization Management” for important information on when prior authorization and certification are required 
     •  The out-of-pocket limit includes your deductible and coinsurance. It does not include charges over the 
       allowed amount; including any charges over the allowable cost difference for out-of-network services and 
       charges for non-covered services

                     Tips for Getting the Most Out of Your Health Care Benefits
      TIPS FOR GETTING THE MOST OUT OF YOUR HEALTH CARE BENEFITS  
      Understand your health care plan  
      The more you know about your benefits, the easier it will be to take control of your health. Let the State Health Plan help 
      you understand your plan and use it effectively through our customer friendly website (www.shpnc.org), toll free 
      Customer Service line (888-234-2416), and your benefits booklet.  
      Manage your out-of-pocket costs by managing the locations in which you 
      receive care  
      Generally speaking, care received in a doctor's office is the most cost effective for you, followed by hospital outpatient 
      services. Hospital inpatient and emergency room services often bear the highest cost. In addition, remember that in--
      network care (services from a Blue Options participating provider who agrees to charge specified rates) will cost you less 
      than similar care provided by an out-of-network provider. You should ask the receptionist whether the provider's office is 
      hospital owned or operated, or provides hospital based services. This may subject your medical services to the outpatient 
      services benefit, which requires deductibles and coinsurance. Know what your financial responsibility is before receiving 
      care.  
      Save on prescription medications 
      Print out the preferred medication list and take it with you when visiting your doctor. Ask your doctor to authorize a 
      generic substitute whenever a generic is available. You will save money using generics since they typically have the 
      lowest copayment. When there is more than one brand name medication available for your medical condition, it is 
      suggested that you ask your physician to prescribe a medication in a lower brand Tier.  
      Pick a Primary Care Provider (PCP)  
      While your health benefit plan does NOT require you to have a primary care provider, we strongly urge you to select and 
      use one. A primary care provider informs you of your health care options, documents your care, and maintains your 
      records for you. In addition, they save you time and unnecessary additional costs by recommending appropriate 
      specialists, coordinating your care with them, and informing them of things such as your medical history and potential 
      medication interactions.

      HOW THE 80/20 PPO PLAN WORKS  
      The 80/20 PPO Plan gives you the freedom to choose any provider — the main difference will be the cost to you, 
      depending on whether you see an in-network or out-of-network provider. This plan also offers members the option to 
      participate in Wellness Activities to receive Premium Credits and additional Wellness Incentives for seeking care from 
      certain providers. 
      Wellness Activities 
      During Open Enrollment, Annual Enrollment, or when enrolling within 30 days of being first eligible, you have the option 
      to complete one wellness activity, the tobacco attestation. A wellness premium credit can lower your monthly employee-
      only premium. See Wellness Premium Credit below.  
      Wellness Premium Credit: Tobacco Attestation 
      During Open Enrollment, Annual Enrollment or when enrolling within 30 days of being first eligible, you will need to 
      attest that you do not use tobacco or will commit to a smoking cessation program by the start of the benefit year or, if 
      enrolling during the benefit year, within 45 days of enrollment. You will need to log into your enrollment system to 
      complete the attestation. Completing this attestation during enrollment will save you $60 per month off of your employee-
      only premium. 
      Wellness Incentives 
      In addition to the Wellness Premium Credit, you can also take advantage of additional Wellness Incentives that lower your 
      out-of-pocket costs and encourage you to save money for various health care services you receive throughout the year.

      Notice Regarding Wellness Activities  
      Your health plan is committed to helping you achieve your best health. Rewards for participating in a wellness program 
      are available to all employees. A reasonable alternative to smoking status (participation in a smoking cessation program) 
      has been provided to you. If your physician recommends a different alternative because he believes the program we make 
      available is not medically appropriate, that recommendation may be accommodated to enable you to achieve the reward. 
      Contact us at 855-859-0966 to make an accommodation request. 
      Blue Options Designated Providers 
      This network of providers, includes various providers and hospitals, has been “designated” because they provide both 
      quality and cost-effective care according to criteria set forth by Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina. To find a 
      Blue Options Designated provider, visit the Plan’s website at www.shpnc.org and click on Find a Doctor or call 888-
      234-2416. Blue Options Designated Providers are noted as “Designated for Cost and Quality.” If your hospital is not on 
      the Blue Options Designated Hospital list, you can still select an in-network hospital, however, your inpatient copay 
      would apply. If you select a hospital that is neither on the Blue Options Designated list or is in-network, you will be 
      subject to out-of-network hospital charges. Blue Options Designated Providers include the following specialist areas: 
      General Surgery, OB-GYN, Gastroenterology, Orthopedics, Cardiology, Neurology and Endocrinology. 
      The Role of a Primary Care Provider (PCP) 
      A Primary Care Provider (PCP) can help you manage your health and make decisions about your health care needs. It is 
      important for you to maintain a relationship with a PCP. If you change PCPs, be sure to have your medical records 
      transferred, especially immunization records, to provide your new doctor with your medical history. You should 
      participate actively in all decisions related to your health care and discuss all treatment options with your health care 
      provider regardless of cost or benefit coverage. If you selected a PCP during enrollment, you may change your PCP at 
                                              6                        Return to Table of Contents  
                                 How the 80/20 PPO Plan Works
      any time. You will receive a new ID card which will include the PCP name on the ID card. PCPs are trained to deal with 
      a broad range of health care issues and can help you to determine when you need a specialist. 
      A Primary Care Provider can practice: 
       • Family Practice/General Practice • Pediatrics 
       • Internal Medicine              • Certified Nurse Practitioner 
       • Physician’s Assistants         • Obstetrics & Gynecology 
      Please note, however, that not every provider in these specialties is available to be a PCP in the Blue Options plan. Please 
      visit the State Health Plan website at www.shpnc.org or call State Health Plan Customer Service to be sure the provider 
      you choose is available to be a Blue Options PCP. You may want to confirm that the provider is in the network before 
      receiving care. 
      If your PCP or specialist leaves the Blue Options provider network and is currently treating you for an ongoing special 
      condition that meets the continuity of care criteria, BCBSNC will notify you 30 days before the provider's termination, as 
      long as BCBSNC receives timely notification from the provider. You may be eligible to elect continuing coverage for a 
      period of time if, at the time of the provider's termination, you meet the eligibility requirements. See Continuity Of Care 
      in "Utilization Management." Please contact the State Health Plan Customer Service at the number in "Who to Contact" 
      for additional information. 
      In-Network Benefits 
      By receiving care from an in-network provider, you receive a higher level of benefit coverage. In-network providers will 
      file claims for you and request prior authorization when necessary. You may want to check with your in-network provider 
      to make sure that prior authorization has been requested. Your in-network provider is required to use the Blue Options 
      network hospital where they practice, unless that hospital cannot provide the services you need. BCBSNC contracts with a 
      broad network of North Carolina providers to deliver covered services to Blue Options members. Please note that dentists 
      and orthodontists do not participate in the Blue Options provider network but there are a limited number of oral 
      maxillofacial surgeons available in-network. However, if the condition is an emergency or if an in-network provider is not 
      reasonably available or that provider type does not participate in the network, benefits will be paid at the in-network level. 
      For more information on BCBSNC’s access to care standards, see the State Health Plan website at www.shpnc.org or call 
      Customer Service at the number given in “Who to Contact.” In-network providers include: 
      •  Doctors — classified as primary care providers (described above) or specialists 
      •  Other Providers — health care professionals, such as physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech pathologists, 
        clinical social workers and nurse practitioners 
      •  Hospitals — both general and specialty hospitals 
      •  Non-hospital facilities — such as skilled nursing facilities, ambulatory surgical centers and substance abuse treatment 
        facilities. 
      You do not need a referral to see a Blue Options provider. To see which providers are available in-network, please refer to 
      a Blue Options provider directory, “Find A Doctor,” on our website at www.shpnc.org or call State Health Plan 
      Customer Service at the number given in "Who to Contact." The list of in-network providers may change from time to 
      time, so please verify that the provider is still in the Blue Options network before receiving care, even if referred by 
      an in-network provider.  
      If you see a Blue Options provider outside of North Carolina, see “Receiving Care When You Are Outside Of North 
      Carolina” for information about requesting prior authorization. 
      Please refer to "Summary of Benefits" to see when deductibles or coinsurance apply to any of your in-network benefits. 
      Also see "Understanding Your Share Of The Cost" for an explanation of deductibles, copayments, coinsurance and out-of-
      pocket limits.

                                How the 80/20 PPO Plan Works
       
      Out-of-Network Benefits 
      With the PPO Plan, you may choose to receive covered services from an out-of-network provider and benefits will be 
      subject to out-of-network benefits and/or reimbursements level. 
      However, if the condition is an emergency, or if in-network providers are not reasonably available to the member as 
      determined by BCBSNC's access to care standards, benefits will be paid at the in-network benefit level. For more 
      information on BCBSNC's access to care standards, see the State Health Plan website at www.shpnc.org or call Customer 
      Service at the number given in "Who to Contact.” If you believe an in-network provider is not reasonably available, you 
      can help assure that benefits are paid at the correct benefit level by calling State Health Plan Customer Service before 
      receiving care from an out-of-network provider. See the number for "Prior Authorization (Certification)" in "Who to 
      Contact."  
      When you see an out-of-network provider, you may be responsible for more of the cost. Out-of-network benefits are 
      generally lower than in-network benefits. In addition, you may be required to pay the difference between the provider’s 
      actual charge and the allowed amount. You eliminate this additional cost by receiving care from in-network providers. 
      The State Health Plan encourages you to discuss the cost of services with out-of-network providers before receiving care 
      so you will be aware of your total financial responsibility. Out-of-network providers may or may not bill the State Health 
      Plan directly for services. If the provider does not bill the State Health Plan, you will need to submit a claim form to the 
      State Health Plan. 
      Out-of-network providers, unlike in-network providers, are not obligated by contract to request prior authorization by the 
      State Health Plan. If you go to an out-of-network provider or receive care outside of North Carolina, it is your 
      responsibility to request or ensure that your provider requests prior authorization by the State Health Plan or its 
      representative. Failure to request prior authorization and obtain certification will result in a full denial of benefits. Before 
      receiving the service, you may want to verify with the State Health Plan or its representative, that certification has been 
      obtained. See “Prospective Review/Prior Authorization” in “Utilization Management” for additional information.  
      Note: Some services may not be covered out-of-network. See "Summary of Benefits" and "Covered Services." See "Out-
      of-Network Benefits Exceptions" and "Emergency and Urgent Care Services." Also see "Mental Health and Substance 
      Abuse Services" for additional information on prior authorization and certification requirements for these services. 
      How to File A Claim 
      If you visit in-network providers, they will file claims for you. If you visit out-of-network providers, you may be 
      responsible for paying for care at the time of service and filing claims for reimbursement. Whenever you need to file a 
      claim, you should mail the completed claim form to: 
       For your medical, mental health      For your prescription medications: 
       and substance abuse services:

      months from the service date will not be paid. You may obtain a claim form, including international claim forms, by 
      visiting the State Health Plan website at www.shpnc.org or calling State Health Plan Customer Service at the number 
      listed in "Who to Contact" For help filing a claim, call State Health Plan Customer Service at the number given in “Who 
      to Contact.”  
      Making an Appointment 
      Call the provider's office and identify yourself as a State Health Plan member. Please ask the receptionist whether the 
      provider's office is hospital-owned or operated or provides hospital-based services. This may subject your in-network 
      medical services to the Outpatient Services benefit. Your provider directory will also help you make this determination. 
      Provider locators are available online at our website or by calling State Health Plan Customer Service at the number 
                                             8                        Return to Table of Contents  
                         How the 80/20 PPO Plan Works
    given in "Who to Contact." If you need non-emergency services after your provider's office has closed, please call your 
    provider's office for their recorded instructions. If you cannot keep an appointment, call the provider’s office as soon as 
    possible. Charges for missed appointments, which providers may require as part of their routine practice, are not covered. 
    Identification (ID) Card 
    Your ID card identifies you as a Blue Options 80/20 (PPO) member and serves as your health and pharmacy ID card. Be 
    sure to carry your ID card with you at all times and present it each time you seek health care. Each dependent will 
    receive their own ID card.  
    If you select a PCP for each family member upon enrollment, each family member’s ID card will have the selected PCP 
    printed on the front of the ID card.  
    Only subscribers and their enrolled eligible dependents may seek services with their card. The State Health Plan may 
    consider unauthorized use of this card to be fraud. To find out how to report fraud go to “Report Suspected Abuse and 
    Fraud” in the Contact Us section of the State Health Plan’s website at www.shpnc.org. The Plan will seek 
    reimbursement for claims incurred with a State Health Plan ID card before coverage is effective or after coverage has 
    ended. 
    If any information on your ID is incorrect or for ID card requests, please visit “Blue Connect” on the Plan’s website at 
    www.shpnc.org or call Customer Service at the number listed in “Who to Contact” or on the back of your ID card.

      In an emergency, in situations where in-network providers are not reasonably available as determined by BCBSNC’s

      level. However, you may be responsible for charges billed separately by the provider which are not eligible for additional 
      reimbursement. If you are billed by the provider, you will be responsible for paying the bill and filing a claim with 
      BCBSNC. 
      If you believe an in-network provider is not reasonably available, you can help assure that benefits are paid at the correct 
      benefit level by calling Customer Service before receiving care from an out-of-network provider.

     80/20 PLAN (PPO) SUMMARY OF BENEFITS  
     The following is a summary of your 80/20 Plan (PPO) benefits. A more complete description of your benefits is found in 
     "Covered Services." General exclusions may also apply. Please see "What Is Not Covered?" As you review the Summary 
     of Benefits chart, keep in mind: 
     •  The copayment amounts are fixed dollar amounts the member must pay for some covered services depending on the 
       provider network selection made at the time of service. 
     •  Multiple office visits or emergency room visits on the same day may result in multiple copayments. 
     •  Coinsurance percentages shown in this section are the portion of the allowed amount that you pay. 
     •  Deductible and coinsurance are based on the allowed amount. 
     •  Services applied to the deductible also count toward any visit or day maximums. 
     •  If your benefit level for services includes deductibles and coinsurance, your provider may collect an estimated amount 
       of these at the time you receive services. 
     •  To receive in-network benefits, you must receive care from a Blue Options in-network provider. However, in an 
       emergency, or when in-network providers are not reasonably available as determined by BCBSNC's access to 
       care standards, you may also receive in-network benefits for care from an out-of-network provider. Please see 
       “Out-of-Network Benefits” and "Emergency and Urgent Care Services" for additional information on emergency care. 
       Access to care standards are available on our website at www.shpnc.org
                                                  or by calling the State Health Plan Customer 
       Service number given in “Who to Contact.” 
     •  If you see an out-of-network provider, you will receive out-of-network benefits unless otherwise approved by the State 
       Health Plan or its representative. 
     •  Out-of-Network Labs: If your provider sends your lab work to an out-of-network lab for processing, your claims will 
       no longer be paid at the in-network coinsurance. Your claims for these services will be paid at the appropriate out-of-
       network deductible coinsurance level. This may result in you having to pay more for out-of-network lab work. Talk to 
       your provider to ensure they are using Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina in-network labs.  
     •  For some services that are not covered benefits, discounts may be available as “value-added benefits.” Please see the 
       section called “Value-Added Programs” in the back of this booklet.  
     •  This plan offers Wellness Premium Credits and Wellness Incentives to encourage decisions that are good for your 
       health. 
     •  To receive Wellness Premium Credits, you must choose which Wellness Activities you would like to participate in 
       during Open Enrollment, Annual Enrollment or within 30 days of becoming first eligible. 
     •  To receive Wellness Incentive discounts, you must use the Primary Care Provider (PCP) on your member 
       identification (ID) card, or you must receive care from a Blue Options Designated provider and/or Blue Options 
       Designated Facility. 
     •  Preventive Care as described under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is covered at 100% so long as any applicable 
       medical management requirements are met. 
     •  Preventive medications listed under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with a prescription written by a provider and filled 
       at a participating pharmacy, are covered at 100%. 
     •  In the formulary, prescription medications are divided into six categories or tiers: (Tier 1), the most cost-effective non-
       specialty medications, which would include mostly generic medications; (Tier 2), preferred brand non-specialty 
       medications, including some high-cost generic medications; (Tier 3), non-preferred brand non-specialty medications 
       and compounds ; (Tier 4), the most cost-effective specialty medications, including generics and some biosimilars; 
       (Tier 5), preferred brand specialty medications, and (Tier 6) non-preferred brand specialty medications. Refer to the 
       State Health Plan website for a list of specialty medications. 
     •  The Plan may use reasonable medical management procedures to determine any coverage limitations or restrictions 
       that may apply

       *Certification Requirements 
       In-network providers outside of North Carolina, except for Veterans Affairs (VA) and military providers, are responsible for 
       requesting prior authorization for inpatient facility services. For all other covered services received outside of North Carolina, you 
       are responsible for ensuring that you or your provider requests prior authorization by the State Health Plan even if you see an 
       in-network provider. 
       Certain services, regardless of the location, require prior authorization and certification in order to receive benefits. If you go to 
       an in-network provider in North Carolina, your provider will request prior authorization when necessary. If you go to an out-of-
       network provider in North Carolina or to any provider outside of North Carolina, you are responsible for requesting or ensuring 
       that your provider requests prior authorization. Failure to request prior authorization and receive certification will result in full 
       denial of benefits. See “Covered Services” and “Prior authorization (pre-service)” in “Utilization Management.”  
       The Plan delegates administration of your mental health and substance abuse benefits to the Plan’s Mental Health Case 
       Manager. Prior authorization and certification by the Plan’s Mental Health Case Manager are required for inpatient and certain 
       outpatient mental health and substance abuse services received from an in-network provider, except for emergencies. Please 
       see the number in “Who to Contact.” 
       For certification for certain prescription medications, your physician may call CVS Caremark at 800-294-5979 to initiate a 
       certification request. 
       NOTICE: Your actual expenses for covered services may exceed the stated coinsurance amount because actual provider 
       charges may not be used to determine the Plan’s and member’s payment obligations. For out-of-network benefits, you may be 
       required to pay for charges over the allowed amount in addition to any deductible and coinsurance amount.

                                   Covered Services
     COVERED SERVICES  
     Covered services described on the following pages are available at both the in-network and out-of-network benefit levels, 
     when medically necessary, unless otherwise noted. If you have a question about whether a certain health care service is 
     covered, and you cannot find the information in "Covered Services," see "Summary of Benefits" or call State Health Plan 
     Customer Service at the number listed in "Who to Contact."  
     Also keep in mind as you read this section: 
     •  Certain services require prior authorization and certification in order for you to avoid a denial of your services. While 
       general categories or services are noted in the sections below as requiring prior authorization, please see “Prospective 
       Review/Prior Authorization” in “Utilization Management” for information about the review process, and visit our 
       website at www.shpnc.org or call State Health Plan Customer Service to ask whether a specific service requires prior 
       authorization and certification. 
     •  Exclusions and limitations may apply to your coverage. Service-specific exclusions are stated along with the benefit 
       description in “Covered Services.” Exclusions that apply to many services are listed in “What Is Not Covered?” To 
       understand the exclusions and limitations that apply to each service, read “Covered Services,” “Summary of Benefits” 
       and “What Is Not Covered?” 
     •  Certain services are covered pursuant to BCBSNC medical policies, which are updated throughout the plan year. These 
       policies lay out the procedure and criteria to determine whether a procedure, treatment, facility, equipment, medication 
       or device is medically necessary and eligible for coverage, investigational or experimental, cosmetic, a convenience 
       item, or requires prior authorization and certification by BCBSNC. The most up-to-date medical policies are available 
       at www.shpnc.org, or call State Health Plan Customer Service at the number listed in “Who to Contact.” 
     Office Services 
     Care you receive from a doctor, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner or nurse midwife as part of an office visit or house 
     call is covered with a copayment, except as otherwise noted in this benefits booklet. Some providers may get ancillary 
     services, such as laboratory services, medical equipment, supplies or specialty medications from third parties. In these 
     cases, you may be billed directly by the ancillary provider. Benefit payments for these services will be based on the type 
     of ancillary provider, its network status, and how the services are billed. If you select a PCP during enrollment, and you 
     use the PCP printed on the front of your ID card, you will pay the lower copay amount each time you see that PCP. 
     Some doctors or other providers may practice in outpatient clinics or provide hospital-based services in their offices. In 
     these cases, the services received may be billed as Outpatient Services and may be subject to your benefit period 
     deductible and coinsurance. See Outpatient Clinic Services in the "Summary of Benefits." These providers are identified 
     in the provider directory, which is available on our website at www.shpnc.org or by calling State Health Plan Customer 
     Service at the number in "Who to Contact." 
     A copayment will not apply if you receive Preventive Care services or other services such as allergy shots or other 
     injections and are not charged for an office visit. 
     Office Services Exclusions 
     Services not covered when billed as an office service include: 
       •  Services in free-standing surgical facilities, independent laboratories, therapy facilities or outpatient hospital 
         departments 
       •  Certain self-injectable prescription medications that can be self-administered. The list of these excluded 
         medications may change from time to time. See our website at www.shpnc.org
                                                         or call State Health Plan Customer 
         Service for a list of these medications excluded in the office. Also see “Prescription Medication Benefits” for 
         information about purchasing prescription medications at the pharmacy.

                                      Covered Services
      Preventive Services 
      The Plan covers preventive care services that can help you stay safe and healthy.  
      Under federal law, you can receive certain covered preventive care services from an in-network provider in an office-
      based, outpatient, or ambulatory surgical setting, or urgent care center, at no cost to you. Please note, this benefit is only 
      for services that indicate a primary diagnosis of preventive or wellness and which are identified by recent federal 
      legislation as being eligible. Services that do not include a primary diagnosis of preventive or wellness will be subject to 
      your in-network benefit level for the location where services are received.  
      In addition, the Plan may use reasonable medical management to determine coverage limitations. Please visit the Plan’s 
      website at www.shpnc.org
                        or call Customer Service at the number in “Who to Contact” for the most up-to-date 
      information on preventive care that is covered under federal law, including any limitations that may apply. Certain over-
      the-counter medications may also be available. These over-the-counter medications are covered only as indicated and 
      when a provider’s prescription is presented at the pharmacy.

        Bone Mass Measurement Services 
      The Plan covers scientifically proven and approved bone mass measurement for the diagnosis and evaluation of 
      osteoporosis or low bone mass during any 23-month period for certain qualified individuals only. Additional follow-
      up bone mass measurement tests will be covered if medically necessary. Please note that bone mass measurement 
      tests will be covered under your diagnostic benefit (not your preventive care benefit) if the claim for these services 
      indicates a primary diagnosis of something other than preventive or wellness. Your diagnostic benefit will be subject 
      to your benefit level for the location where services are received. 
      Qualified individuals include members who have any one of the following conditions: 
      • Estrogen-deficient and at clinical risk of osteoporosis or low bone mass

      Increased/high-risk individuals are those who have a higher potential of developing colon cancer because of a 
      personal or family history of certain intestinal disorders. Some of these procedures are considered surgery, such as 
      colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, and others are considered lab tests, such as hemoccult screenings. Lab work done as 
      a result of a colorectal screening exam will be covered under your diagnostic benefit and not be considered preventive 
      care. It will be subject to your benefit level for the location where services are received. However, lab work for the 
      removal of polyps during the screening exam is considered preventive care. 
         Gynecological Exam and Cervical Cancer Screening 
       The cervical cancer screening benefit includes the examination and laboratory tests for early detection and screening 
       of cervical cancer, and a doctor’s interpretation of the lab results. Coverage for cervical cancer screening includes Pap 
      smear screening, liquid-based cytology, and human papilloma virus detection, and shall follow the American Cancer 
      Society guidelines or guidelines adopted by the North Carolina Advisory Committee on Cancer Coordination and

        •  Has a mother, sister, or daughter who has or has had breast cancer, or 
        •  Has not given birth before the age of 30. 
      Diagnostic Services 
      Diagnostic procedures help your physician find the cause and extent of your condition in order to plan for your care. 
      Benefits may differ depending on where the service is performed and if the service is associated with a surgical procedure. 
      For member responsibility see Physician Office Services or Outpatient Diagnostic Services in "Summary of Benefits," 
      depending on where services are received.  
      Separate benefits for interpretation of diagnostic services by the attending doctor are not provided in addition to benefits 
      for that doctor's medical or surgical services, except as otherwise determined by the State Health Plan or its 
      representative. 
      Out-of-Network Labs: If your provider sends your lab work to an out-of-network lab for processing, your claims will no 
      longer be paid at the in-network coinsurance. Your claims for these services will be paid at the appropriate out-of-network 
      coinsurance. This may result in you having to pay more for out-of-network lab work. Talk to your provider to ensure they 
      are using Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina in-network labs.  
        Laboratory, Radiology and Other Diagnostic Testing 
        Laboratory studies are services such as diagnostic blood or urine tests or examination of biopsied tissue (that is, tissue 
        removed from your body by a surgical procedure). Radiology services are diagnostic imaging procedures such as X-
        rays, ultrasounds, computed tomographic (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Other diagnostic 
        testing includes electroencephalograms (EEGs), electrocardiograms (ECGs), Doppler scans and pulmonary function 
        tests (PFTs). Certain diagnostic imaging procedures, such as CT scans and MRIs, may require prior authorization and 
        certification or services will not be covered. 
      Diagnostic Services Exclusion 
        •  Lab test that are not ordered by your doctor or other provider.

        •  Between a hospital and a skilled nursing facility when such a facility is the closest one that can provide covered 
           services appropriate to the member’s condition 
        •  Benefits may also be provided for ambulance services from a hospital or skilled nursing facility to a member’s 
           home when medically necessary. 
        Transport to and from a dialysis center: 
                                             22                       Return to Table of Contents

        renal disease, and Medicare is the member’s primary insurance. 
      • Transportation to or from a dialysis center for members other than those noted above will not be covered unless it 
        is determined to be medically necessary. 
      Medical documentation from a physician may be required to substantiate medical necessity of transport by ambulance 
      and that other means of transportation would be contraindicated for your condition. 
       Ambulance transportation services will be reviewed for medical necessity in the case of: 
      • Ambulance services from a hospital or skilled nursing facility to a member’s home 
      • Non-emergency air ambulance services 
      The Plan covers services in an air ambulance traveling from the site of an emergency to a hospital when such a 
      facility is the closest one that can provide covered services appropriate to the member’s condition. Air ambulance 
      services are eligible for coverage only when ground transportation is not medically appropriate due to the severity of 
      the illness, or the pick-up point is inaccessible by land. 
       • Non-emergency air ambulance services require prior authorization and certification or services will not be 
         covered. 
         Ambulance Service Exclusion 
         • No benefits are provided primarily for the convenience of travel or where not medically necessary. 
        • Transportation for the purpose of receiving services that are not considered covered services, even if the 
          destination is an appropriate facility.  
         Emergency Care 
       The Plan provides benefits for emergency services.  
      An emergency is the sudden or unexpected onset of a condition of such severity that a prudent layperson, who 
      possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of immediate medical 
      attention to result in any of the following: 
        •  Placing the health of an individual, or with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the pregnant woman or 
          her unborn child, in serious jeopardy 
        •  Serious physical impairment to bodily functions 
        •  Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part 
        •  Death 
      Heart attacks, strokes, uncontrolled bleeding, poisonings, major burns, prolonged loss of consciousness, spinal 
      injuries, shock and other severe, acute conditions are examples of emergencies. 
         What to do in an Emergency 
       In an emergency, you should seek care from an emergency room or other similar facility. If necessary and available, 
       call 911 or use other community emergency resources to obtain assistance in handling life-threatening emergencies. 
       Prior authorization is not required for emergency services. Your visit to the emergency room will be covered if your 
       condition meets the definition of an emergency.

                                         are not eligible for additional reimbursement. You 
                                         may be required to pay the entire bill at the time of 
                                         service and file a claim. Prior authorization and

          Urgent Care 
        The Plan also provides benefits for urgent care services.

    Statement of Rights Under The Newborns' And Mothers' Health Protection Act 
    Under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group health insurance coverage generally 
    may not restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child to 
    less than 48 hours following a vaginal delivery, or less than 96 hours following a delivery by cesarean section.  However, 
    the Plan or issuer may pay for a shorter stay if the attending provider (e.g., your doctor, nurse midwife or physician 
    assistant), after consultation with the mother, discharges the mother or newborn earlier. 
    Also, under federal law, group health plans and health insurance issuers may not set the level of benefits or out-of-pocket 
    costs so that any later portion of the 48 hour (or 96 hour) stay is treated in a manner less favorable to the mother or 
    newborn than any earlier portion of the stay. 
    In addition, a plan or issuer may not, under federal law, require that a doctor or other health care provider obtain 
    certification for prescribing a length of stay of up to 48 hours (or 96 hours).  However, to use certain providers or 
    facilities, or to reduce your out-of-pocket costs, you may be required to obtain certification.  For information on 
    certification, contact State Health Plan Customer Service at the number given in “Who to Contact.”

      be enrolled for coverage as a dependent child, according to the rules in "When Coverage Begins and Ends." At this

           How to Access Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services 
         When you need mental health or substance abuse treatment, you should call a Mental Health Case Manager customer 
         service representative at the number given in "Who to Contact" available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Mental 
         Health Case Manager customer service representative will refer you to a list of in-network providers and will give 
         you the information you need to receive services. Language services are available free of charge through your Mental 
         Health Case Manager. Please let the Customer Service representative know if you need an interpreter to talk about 
         your behavioral health benefits or help in translating any letters you receive from your Mental Health Case Manager 
         regarding your care. 
         Certification for Inpatient and Outpatient Services 
         Prior to seeking care in an inpatient hospital, a Residential Treatment Center, partial day/night programs or intensive 
         outpatient treatment programs, you or your provider must receive certification from the Mental Health Case 
                                                                   SM
         Manager. In order to receive in-network benefits, you must go to a Blue Options network provider. You may want 
         to check with your in-network provider to make sure that certification has been obtained for services. Your in-network 
                                         SM network hospital where they practice, unless that hospital cannot 
         provider is required to use the Blue Options
         provide the services needed.  
         If you choose to go to an out-of-network provider without obtaining certification for inpatient or outpatient services, 
         or you go to any provider outside of North Carolina without obtaining certification for services, it will result in a full 
         denial of your services.  
         If you receive certification for out-of-network services, the services will be considered at the out-of-network benefit 
         level. However, if in-network providers are not available as determined by BCBSNC's access to care standards and 
         certification is obtained, the Mental Health Case Manager will authorize the services to be covered at the in-network 
         benefit level.

                             Covered Services
      Emergency inpatient admissions do not require certification prior to the admission. However, you or your provider 
      should notify the Mental Health Case Manager of your inpatient admissions. See table below for timeframes in order 
      to meet the Plan’s requirements for prior authorization and continuing treatment certifications of covered services.  
      You should work with your doctor or other professional provider to make sure that certification has been obtained for 
      partial-day/night, intensive therapy, or inpatient services. See "Utilization Management." Contact the Mental Health 
      Case Manager at the number given in "Who to Contact" for certification. 
      Outside of North Carolina  
      Although prior authorization is not required in an emergency, you may contact the Mental Health Case Manager for 
      assistance in locating a provider.  
      If you need urgent inpatient or outpatient mental health or substance abuse services while outside North Carolina, 
      contact Customer Service at the number listed in “Who to Contact” for assistance in locating a provider. You must 
      request prior authorization and receive certification from the Mental Health Case Manager for mental health and 
      substance abuse services other than office visits or in emergencies. The numbers for Mental Health Case Manager are 
      provided in “Who to Contact” and on the back of your ID card. For more information on these services, see “Covered

        *The following notice applies only when you are responsible for obtaining certification. NOTICE: Your actual

        benefits, you may be required to pay for charges over the allowed amount in addition to any copayment or 
        coinsurance amount. In addition, certain services require prior authorization and certification. You are 
        responsible for obtaining or having your provider obtain certification on your behalf if you go to an out-of-
        network, or out-of-state provider. Failure to obtain certification will result in a full denial of benefits

      Pharmacy Benefits 
          Prescription Medication Copayment and Benefits 
        A Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) manages administration of the pharmacy benefit.  
        Your pharmacy benefit offers a custom, closed formulary, which means that certain medications are not covered. For 
        more information on commonly used covered medications, see the information listed under the Preferred Medication 
        List section below. A complete list of covered medications can be found on the State Health Plan’s website. 
        If you would like an updated copy of the formulary or you want to check the tier placement of a specific medication, 
        please call the PBM at the number listed in "Who to Contact" or visit the State Health Plan website. 
        Certain prescription medications may either require certification (also known as prior approval) or be subject to step 
        therapy, quantity limits or other forms of formulary coverage review in order to be covered based on criteria 
        developed by the State Health Plan or its representative. It is very important to make sure that prior approval is 
        received before going to the pharmacy.  
                                          41                       Return to Table of Contents  
                             Covered Services
      To get a list of prescription medications that require prior approval to be covered or require approval for additional 
      quantities, you may call Pharmacy Customer Service at the number listed in "Who to Contact" or visit the State 
      Health Plan website. The State Health Plan or its representative may change the list of these prescription medications 
      from time to time. 
      Prescription medication synchronization as follows: 
      If you have multiple prescriptions and need to align your refill dates you may need a prescription for less than a 30-
      day supply. If your doctor or pharmacy agrees to give you a prescription for less than a 30-day supply for this purpose 
      you will only pay a prorated daily cost-sharing amount (any dispensing fee will not be prorated). This benefit is only 
      available for medications covered under your pharmacy benefit, received at an in-network pharmacy, and when prior 
      authorization requirements have been met.  
      In addition, the medications must: 
        • be used for treatment and management of chronic conditions and are subject to refills 
        • NOT be a Schedule II or Schedule III controlled substance containing hydrocodone 
        • be able to be split over short-fill periods 
        • not have quantity limits or dose optimization criteria that would be affected by aligning refill dates 
      Prescription medication indicated to treat infertility will be included in this benefit limit as they are approved by the 
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Visit www.shpnc.org for the most up-to-date information or call State 
      Health Plan Customer Service. 
      Keep in mind that your provider must write a prescription and it must be filled at a participating pharmacy. 
      Additionally, there may be some prescription medications that are administered by a provider in a medical office that 
      may be limited to coverage under your medical benefit. 
      For certification of your prescription medications, your physician may call the PBM’s Prior Authorization 
      number listed in “Who to Contact” to initiate a certification request. 
        Affordable Care Act Preventive Medications  
      Medications that are identified as preventive by the Affordable Care Act are covered for members on this plan at 
      100%. Members must meet certain criteria for these medications to be covered at 100% and a provider must write a 
      prescription for the medication to be filled at a participating pharmacy in order for a $0 copay to be applied. 
        Covered Medication List  
      The State Health Plan, with guidance from the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (P & T Committee), compiles 
       the list of covered medications also known as the Comprehensive Formulary Document. The Comprehensive 
      Formulary Document can be obtained from the State Health Plan's website or by calling the PBM at the number listed 
      in "Who to Contact" The Comprehensive Formulary Document is subject to change without notification. 
      • Generic medications are often an effective alternative to brand medications. Ask your physician to consider Tier 1 
        generic medications whenever possible. Some higher cost generics may be in Tier 2. If a generic medication is 
        not available, you will be responsible for paying the higher copayment based on the tier placement for the brand 
        name medication.  
      • When there is more than one brand name medication available for your medical condition, it is suggested that you 
        ask your physician to prescribe a medication on the Comprehensive Formulary Document on the lowest tier. This 
        may reduce your copayment. 
      The Comprehensive Formulary Document is divided into six categories or tiers: (Tier 1), the most cost-effective non-
      specialty medications, which would include mostly generic medications; (Tier 2), preferred brand non-specialty 
      medications, including some high-cost generic medications; (Tier 3), non-preferred brand non-specialty medications 
      and compounds ; (Tier 4), the most cost-effective specialty medications, including generics and some biosimilars; 
      (Tier 5), preferred brand specialty medications, and (Tier 6) non-preferred brand specialty medications. Refer to the 
      State Health Plan website for a list of specialty medications. The placement of medicaitons in a formulary tier 
      determines what copayment or coinsurance will be charged for a 30-day supply. Tiers 3 and 6 are subject to 
      deductible/coinsurance and do not have a copayment. 
                                  42                 Return to Table of Contents  
                             Covered Services
      Tiers 3 and 6 prescriptions are subject to the benefit period deductible and coinsurance amounts and are applied to the 
      pharmacy out-of-pocket maximums  
      Charges for prescription medications do not apply to the medical out-of-pocket limit but apply to the benefit period 
      total out-of-pocket limit. 
      Please remember that if you regularly order a medication when only 75 percent of the quantity has been used, you will 
      accumulate an excess supply and the refill date may be adjusted. To avoid having a refill delayed, please follow these 
      guidelines: 
        • For a 30-day retail prescription, order a refill when you have no more than a 7-day supply remaining. (For a 
          30-day mail order prescription, you may order the refill a few days earlier, to ensure you received the refill 
          before the medication on hand has been used.) 
        • For a 90-day retail or mail order prescription, request the refill when you have no more than a 14-day supply 
          remaining. 
      If a prescription reflects a change in dosage, it is treated like a new prescriptions and the look back period starts over 
      from zero. However, if a new prescription is identical to the previous one, the system will continue to look back 180 
      days to determine if the refill can be approved. 
      If you order a refill at a participating retail pharmacy too soon, you will be asked to wait until the allowable refill date. 
      If you order the refill through the CVS Mail Order Pharmacy, the pharmacy may hold the refill until the allowable 
      date. 
      Exceptions to this refill policy can be made under certain circumstances. 
        Specialty Pharmacy 
      Specialty and biosimilar medications are designated and classified by the Plan as medications that meet the following 
      criteria and are listed on the Specialty Medication List, which is located on the State Health Plan’s website at 
      www.shpnc.org.  
      • Treats complex medical conditions(s) 
      • Requires frequent clinical monitoring, e.g. dosing adjustments 
      • Requires special patient education, training and/or coordination of care 
      • Generally prescribed by a specialist provider 
      If you use specialty medications, you must use the contracted specialty vendor for all specialty medications covered 
      under the pharmacy benefit, excluding cancer medications. If you use a pharmacy other than the contracted vendor to 
      purchase any specialty medications, you will be responsible for paying the total amount of the prescription at the time 
      of purchase. For more information call the specialty pharmacy at the number listed in "Who to Contact."

          Medicare Part D 
                           IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING 
                  YOUR PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION COVERAGE AND MEDICARE 
          Effective January 1, 2006, Medicare began offering prescription medication coverage for all persons 
          enrolled in Medicare. The State Health Plan will continue to provide prescription medication 
          coverage for all members on this plan.  
          When members become eligible for Medicare Part D, they will receive a notice of creditable 
          coverage from the State Health Plan. "Creditable Coverage" means that your prescription 
          medication coverage is at least as good as Part D coverage. 
          If your current prescription medication coverage qualifies as "creditable coverage," you should not 
          need Part D coverage, unless you are Medicaid eligible or eligible for low-income assistance. 
          Members of the State Health Plan should evaluate their own coverage needs prior to purchasing a 
          Medicare Prescription Medication Plan. 
        Part D: Is provided* by the State Health Plan and pays for prescription medication coverage. 
        *High income members may be subject to an income-related monthly adjustment amount by Social Security.

             UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT  
             To make sure you have access to high quality, cost effective health care, the State Health Plan has a Utilization 
             Management (UM) program. The UM program requires that certain health care services be reviewed and 
             approved by the State Health Plan or its representative in order to receive benefits. As part of this process, the 
             State Health Plan determines whether health care services are medically necessary, provided in the proper 
             setting and for a reasonable length of time.  
             The State Health Plan will honor a certification to cover medical services or supplies under your health 
             benefit plan unless the certification  
             •     Was based on a material misrepresentation about your health condition  
             •     You were not eligible for these services under your health benefit plan due to termination of coverage  
             •     Nonpayment of premiums. 
                          
             Rights and Responsibilities Under the UM Program 
                     Your Member Rights 
                   Under the UM program, you have the right to: 
                   •     A UM decision that is timely, meeting applicable federal time frames 
                   •     The reasons for denial of a requested treatment or health care service, including an explanation of the UM criteria 
                         and treatment protocol used to reach the decision 
                   •     Have a medical director from the State Health Plan or its representative make a review of all denials of service 
                         that were based upon medical necessity 
                   •     Request a review of denial of benefit coverage through the grievance process. See "What If You Disagree With A 
                         Decision?" 
                   •     Have an authorized representative pursue payment of a claim or make an appeal on your behalf. 
                   An authorized representative may act on the member's behalf with the member's written consent. In the 
                   event you appoint an authorized representative, references to "you" under the "Utilization Management" 
                   section mean "you or your authorized representative" (i.e., the authorized representative may pursue your 
                   rights and will receive all notices and benefit determinations). 
                     The State Health Plan's Responsibilities 
                   As part of all UM decisions, the State Health Plan or its representative will: 
                   •     Provide you and your provider with a toll-free telephone number to call UM review staff when certification of a 
                         health care service is needed. See "Who to Contact." 
                   •     Limit what the State Health Plan or its representative requests from you or your provider to information that is 
                         needed to review the service in question 
                   •     Request all information necessary to make the UM decision, including pertinent clinical information 
                   •     Provide you and your provider prompt notification of the UM decision consistent with your health benefit plan. 
                   In the event the State Health Plan or its representative does not receive sufficient information to approve 
                   coverage for a health care service within specified time frames, your health benefit plan will notify you in 
                   writing that benefit coverage has been denied. The notice will explain how you may pursue a review of the 
                   UM decision. 
             Prior Authorization (Pre-Service) 
             The State Health Plan requires that certain health care services receive prior authorization as noted in “Covered 
             Services.” These types of reviews are called pre-service reviews. If neither you nor your provider requests prior 
             authorization and receives certification, this will result in a complete denial of benefits. The list of services that 
             require prior authorization may change from time to time. 
                                                                                                     52                                                         Return to Table of Contents  
                                      Utilization Management
      General categories of services with this requirement are noted in “Covered Services.” You may also visit our 
      website at www.shpnc.org or call Customer Service at the number listed in "Who to Contact" for a detailed list 
      of services.  
      In-network providers outside of North Carolina, except for Veterans’ Affairs (VA) and military providers, are 
      responsible for requesting prior authorization for inpatient facility services. For all other covered services 
      received outside of North Carolina, you are responsible for ensuring that you or your provider requests prior 
      authorization by the State Health Plan even if you see an in-network provider. 
      If you fail to follow the procedures for filing a request, the Plan or its authorized representative will notify you 
      of the failure and the proper procedures to be followed in filing your request within five days of receiving the 
      request.  
      The State Health Plan or its representative will make a decision on your request for certification within a 
      reasonable amount of time taking into account the medical circumstances. The decision will be made and 
      communicated within three business days after the State Health Plan or its representative receives all necessary 
      information, but no later than 15 days from the date your request has been received. If your request is 
      incomplete, then within five days of receipt of your request, you and your provider will be notified of how to 
      properly complete your request. The State Health Plan or its representative may also take an extension of up to 
      15 days, if additional information is needed. The State Health Plan or its representative will notify you and your 
      provider before the end of the initial 15-day period of the information needed and the date by which the State 
      Health Plan or its representative expects to make a decision. You will have 45 days to provide the requested 
      information. As soon as the State Health Plan or its representative receives the requested information, or at the 
      end of the 45 days, whichever is earlier, a decision will be made within three business days. The State Health 
      Plan or its representative will notify you and your provider of an adverse benefit determination electronically or 
      in writing. 
      If the requested certification is denied, you have the right to appeal. See "What If You Disagree with a Decision?" for 
      additional information. Certain services may not be covered out-of-network. See “Covered Services.” 
          Urgent Prior Authorization 
        You have a right to an urgent authorization when the regular time frames for a decision: (i) could seriously 
        jeopardize your life, health, or safety or the life, health or safety of others, due to your psychological state, 
        or (ii) in the opinion of a practitioner with knowledge of your medical or behavioral condition, would 
        subject you to adverse health consequences without the care or treatment that is the subject of the request. 
        The State Health Plan will let you and your provider know of its decision within 72 hours after receiving 
        the request. Your provider will be notified of the decision, and if the decision results in an adverse benefit 
        determination, written notification will be given to you and your provider.  
        If the Plan needs more information to process your urgent authorization, the Plan will let you and your 
        provider know of the information needed as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours following the receipt 
        of your request. You will then be given a reasonable amount of time, but not less than 48 hours, to provide 
        the requested information. The Plan will make a decision on your request within a reasonable time but no 
        later than 48 hours after receipt of requested information or within 48 hours after the time period given to 
        the provider to submit necessary clinical information, whichever comes first.  
        An urgent authorization may be requested by calling Customer Service at the number given in “Who to 
      Contact.” 
      Concurrent Authorization 
      The State Health Plan or its representative will also review health care services at the time you receive them. 
      These types of reviews are concurrent reviews.  
                                            53                        Return to Table of Contents  
                             Utilization Management
    If a request for an extension of treatment is non-urgent, a decision will be made and communicated to the 
    requesting hospital or other facility within three business days after receipt of all necessary clinical information, 
    but no later than 15 days after we receive the request. 
    In the event of an adverse benefit determination, the Plan will let you, your hospital’s or other facility’s UM 
    department and your provider know within three business days after receipt of all necessary clinical 
    information, but no later than 15 days after receiving the request. Written confirmation of the decision will also 
    be sent to your home by U.S. mail.  
    For concurrent reviews, the Plan will remain responsible for covered services you are receiving until you or 
    your representatives have been notified of the adverse benefit determination. 
        Urgent Concurrent Authorization 
      You have a right to an expedited review when the regular time frames for a decision: (i) could seriously 
      jeopardize your or your dependent's life, health, or ability to regain maximum function; or (ii) in the opinion 
      of your provider, would subject you or your dependent to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed 
      without the requested care or treatment. 
      If a request for an extension of treatment is urgent, and the request is received at least 24 hours before the 
      expiration of a previously approved inpatient stay or course of treatment at the requesting hospital or other 
      facility, a decision will be made and communicated to the requesting hospital or other facility as soon as 
      possible, but no later than 24 hours after we receive the request. 
      If a request for extension of treatment is urgent, and the request is not received at least 24 hours before the 
      expiration of a previously approved inpatient stay or course of treatment at the requesting hospital or other 
      facility, a decision will be made and communicated as soon as possible but no later than 72 hours after we 
      receive the request.  
      If the State Health Plan or its representative need more information to process your urgent review, the Plan 
      will notify the requesting hospital or other facility of the information needed as soon as possible but no later 
      than 24 hours after we receive the request. The requesting hospital or other facility will then be given a 
      reasonable amount of time, but not less than 48 hours, to provide the requested information. The Plan or its 
      representative will make a decision within 48 hours after receipt of the requested information, or within 48 
      hours after the deadline given to the requesting hospital or other facility to provide the information, 
      whichever comes first. 
    Retrospective Authorization (Post-Service) 
    The State Health Plan or its representative also reviews the coverage of health care services after you receive 
    them (retrospective reviews). Retrospective review may include a review to determine if services received in an 
    emergency setting qualify as an emergency. The State Health Plan or its representative will make all 
    retrospective review decisions and notify you of its decision within a reasonable time but no later than 30 days 
    from the date the State Health Plan or its representative received the request.  
    In the event of an adverse benefit determination, the Plan or its representative will notify you and your provider 
    in writing within five business days of the decision. All decisions will be based on medical necessity and 
    whether the service received was a benefit under the Plan. If more information is needed before the end of the 
    initial 30-day period, the Plan or its representative will notify you of the information needed. You will then 
    have 90 days to provide the requested information. As soon as the Plan or its representative receives the 
    requested information, or at the end of the 90 days, whichever is earlier, the Plan or its representative will make 
    a decision within 15 days.  
    Services that were approved in advance by the Plan or its representative will not be subject to denial for 
    medical necessity once the claim is received, unless the certification was based on a material 
                                  54                 Return to Table of Contents  
                                  Utilization Management
     misrepresentation about your health condition or you were not eligible for these services under your 
     health benefit plan due to termination of coverage or nonpayment of premiums. All other services may be 
     subject to retrospective review and could be denied for medical necessity or for a benefit limitation or exclusion. 
     Care Management 
     Members with complicated and/or chronic medical needs may be eligible for care management services. Care 
     management, also known as case management, encourages members with complicated or chronic medical 
     needs, their providers, and the State Health Plan or its representative to work together to identify the 
     appropriate services to meet the individual’s health needs and promote quality outcomes. To accomplish this, 
     members enrolled in or eligible for care management programs may be contacted by the State Health Plan or by 
     a representative of the State Health Plan.  
     Care Management services are provided solely at the option of the State Health Plan or its representative, and 
     the State Health Plan is not obligated to provide the same benefits or services to a member at a later date or to 
     any other member. Information about these services can be obtained by calling State Health Plan Customer 
     Service. 
     Continuity of Care 
     Continuity of care is a process that allows you to continue receiving care from an out-of-network provider for an 
     ongoing special condition at the in-network benefit level when you or your employer changes health benefit 
     plans or when your provider is no longer in the Blue Options network.  
     If your PCP or specialist leaves the Blue Options network and they are currently treating you for an ongoing 
     special condition that meets the Plan’s continuity of care criteria, the Plan will notify you 30 days before the 
     provider’s termination, as long as the Plan receives timely notification from the provider. 
     To be eligible for continuity of care, you must be actively being seen by an out-of-network provider for an 
     ongoing special condition and the provider must agree to abide by the State Health Plan’s or its representative’s 
     requirements for continuity of care.  
     An ongoing special condition means: 
       •  In the case of an acute illness, a condition that is serious enough to require medical care or treatment to avoid a 
          reasonable possibility of death or permanent harm 
       •  In the case of a chronic illness or condition, a disease or condition that is life-threatening, degenerative, or 
          disabling, and requires medical care or treatment over a prolonged period of time 
       •  In the case of pregnancy, the second and third trimesters of pregnancy 
       •  In the case of a terminal illness, an individual has a medical prognosis that the member’s life expectancy is six 
          months or less 
     The allowed transitional period shall extend up to 90 days, as determined by the provider, except in the cases 
     of: 
       •  Scheduled surgery, organ transplantation, or inpatient care which shall extend through the date of discharge and 
          post discharge follow-up care or other inpatient care occurring within 90 days of the date of discharge 
       •  Second trimester pregnancy which shall extend through the provision of 60 days of postpartum care 
       •  Terminal illness which shall extend through the remainder of the individual’s life with the respect to care directly 
          related to the treatment of the terminal illness 
     Continuity of care requests will be reviewed by a medical professional based on the information provided about specific 
     medical conditions. Claims for approved continuity of care services will be paid at the in-network benefit level. In these 
     situations, benefits are based on the billed amount. However, you may be responsible for charges billed separately by the 
     provider which are not eligible for additional reimbursement. If your continuity of care request is denied, you may request 
     a review through our appeals process (see “What if I Disagree with a Decision”). Continuity of care will not be provided

      when the provider’s contract was terminated for reasons relating to quality of care or fraud. Such a decision may not be 
      reviewed on appeal. Please call State Health Plan Customer Service at the number listed in “Who to Contact” for 
      additional information. 
      Further Review of Utilization Management Decisions 
      If you receive a non-certification as part of the prior authorization process, you have the right to request that the 
      State Health Plan or its representative review the decision through the grievance process. Refer to "What If 
      You Disagree With A Decision?” 
      Delegated Utilization Management 
      Your Mental Health Case Manager is responsible for UM and the first level grievance review for inpatient and 
      outpatient mental health and substance abuse services. The Case Manager’s decision making is based on the 
      appropriateness of care and service as well as existence of coverage. Claim determinations and second level 
      grievance reviews are provided by the State Health Plan or its representative. The Mental Health Case 
      Manager does not reward practitioners, or other individuals, for issuing denials of coverage or service. 
      Financial incentives are not given that would encourage decisions resulting in less care than needed. 
      Evaluating New Technology 
      In an effort to allow for continuous quality improvement, the State Health Plan or its representative has processes in place 
      to evaluate new medical technology, procedures and equipment. These policies allow the State Health Plan or its 
      representative to determine the best services and products to offer members. They also help the State Health Plan or its 
      representative to keep pace with the ever-advancing medical field. Before implementing any new or revised policies, the 
      State Health Plan or its representative reviews professionally supported scientific literature as well as state and federal 
      guidelines, regulations, recommendations, and requirements. The State Health Plan or its representative then seeks 
      additional input from providers who know the needs of the patients they serve.

      WHAT IF YOU DISAGREE WITH A DECISION? 
      In addition to the UM program, your health benefit plan offers a grievance procedure for members. Grievances 
      include dissatisfaction with a claims denial or any decisions (including an appeal of a non-certification 
      decision), policies or actions related to the availability, delivery or quality of health care services. If you have a 
      grievance, you have the right to request that the State Health Plan or its representative review the decision 
      through the grievance process.  
      Grievances are not allowed for benefits or services that are clearly excluded by this benefits booklet or for 
      deductibles, coinsurance or out-of-pocket limit, as well as other aspects of coverage excluded from appeal 
      by law.  
      The grievance process is voluntary and may be requested by the member or an authorized representative acting 
      on the member's behalf with the member's written consent. In the event you appoint an authorized 
      representative, references to "you" under this section mean "you or your authorized representative" (i.e., the 
      authorized representative may pursue your rights and shall receive all notices and benefit determinations).  
      For each step in this process, there are specified time frames for filing a grievance and for notifying you or your 
      provider of the decision.  
      In addition, members may also receive assistance with grievances from the Health Insurance Smart NC, a 
      program offered by the North Carolina Department of Insurance by/ contacting:

      Steps To Follow In the Grievance Process 
          First Level Grievance Review 
        The review must be requested in writing, within 180 days of a denial of benefit coverage. To request a form 
        to submit a first level grievance review, visit the State Health Plan website or call State Health Plan 
        Customer Service at the number given in "Who to Contact."  
        Any request for review should include: 
              •  Member’s ID number        •  Patient's name 
              •  Member’s name             •  The nature of the grievance 
              •  Any other information that may be helpful for the review. 
        Although you are not allowed to participate in a first level grievance review, the State Health Plan or its 
        representative asks that you send all of the written material you feel is necessary to make a decision. The 
        State Health Plan or its representative will use the material provided in the request for review, along with 
        other available information, to reach a decision. You will be notified in clear written terms of the decision 
        within a reasonable time but no later than 30 days from the date the State Health Plan or its representative 
        received the request. You may then request, free of charge, all information that was relevant to the review. 
          Second Level Grievance Review 
        If you are dissatisfied with the first level grievance review decision, you have the right to a second level 
        grievance review. Second level grievances are not allowed for benefits or services that are clearly excluded 
        by this benefit booklet or for quality of care complaints. The request must be made in writing within 180 
                                            57                        Return to Table of Contents  
                         Additional Terms of Your Coverage
      days of the first level grievance review decision. Within ten business days after the State Health Plan or its 
      representative receives your request for a second level grievance review, the following information will be 
      given to you: 
      • Name, address and telephone number of the grievance coordinator 
      • A statement of your rights, including the right to: 
          • request and receive from the State Health Plan or its representative all information that applies to 
            your case 
          • participate in the second level grievance review meeting 
          • present your case to the review panel 
          • submit supporting material before and during the review meeting 
          • ask questions of any member of the review panel 
          • be assisted or represented by a person of your choosing, including a family member, an employer 
            representative, or an attorney. 
      The second level review meeting, which will be conducted by a review panel coordinated by the State 
      Health Plan or its representative using external physicians and/or benefit experts, will be held within 45 
      days after the State Health Plan or its representative receives a second level grievance review request. You 
      will receive notice of the meeting date and time at least 15 days before the meeting. You have the right to a 
      full review of your grievance even if you do not participate in the meeting. A written decision will be issued 
      to you within seven business days of the review meeting. 
        Expedited Review 
      You have the right to a more rapid or expedited review of a denial of coverage if a delay: (i) would 
      reasonably appear to seriously jeopardize your or your dependent's life, health or ability to regain maximum 
       function; or (ii) in the opinion of your provider, would subject you or your dependent to severe pain that 
       cannot be adequately managed without the requested care or treatment. You can request an expedited 
       second level review even if you did not request that the initial review be expedited.  
       An expedited review may be initiated by calling State Health Plan Customer Service at the number listed in 
       "Who to Contact." An expedited review will take place in consultation with a medical doctor. All of the 
       same conditions for a first level or second level grievance review apply to an expedited review. The State 
       Health Plan or its representative will communicate the decision by phone to you and your provider as soon 
       as possible, taking into account the medical circumstances, but no later than 72 hours after receiving the 
       request. A written decision will be communicated within four days after receiving the request for the 
       expedited appeal. Information initially given by telephone must also be given in writing.  
       After requesting an expedited review, the State Health Plan will remain responsible for covered health care 
       services you are receiving until you have been notified of the review decision. 
         External Review 
       North Carolina law provides for review of non-certification decisions by an external, independent review 
       organization (IRO). The relevant statutory provision is N.C.G.S. § 58-50-80. The North Carolina 
       Department of Insurance (NCDOI) administers this service at no charge to you, arranging for an IRO to 
       review your case once the NCDOI establishes that your request is complete and eligible for review. 
       The State Health Plan will notify you of your right to request an external review each time you receive: 
         •  A non-certification decision or, 
         •  An appeal decision upholding a non-certification decision. 
       In order for your request to be eligible for an external review, the NCDOI must determine the following: 
         •  Your request is about a medical necessity determination that resulted in non-certification; 
                                  58                 Return to Table of Contents  
                         Additional Terms of Your Coverage
         • You had coverage with the State Health Plan when the non-certification was issued; 
         • The service for which the non-certification was issued appears to be a covered service; and 
         • You have exhausted the State Health Plan’s first and second level grievance process as described 
           above. 
      External reviews are performed on a standard or expedited basis, depending on which is requested and on 
      whether medical circumstances meet the criteria for expedited review. 
        Standard External Review 
      For all requests for a standard external review, you must file your request with the NCDOI within 120 days 
      of receiving one of the notices listed above. If the request for an external review is related to a retrospective 
      non-certification (a non-certification which occurs after you have already received the services in question), 
      the 60-day time limit for receiving the State Health Plan’s second level determination does not apply. You 
      will not be eligible to request an external review until you have exhausted the internal appeal process and 
      have received a written second level grievance determination from the State Health Plan or its 
      representative.  
      For a standard external review, you will have exhausted the internal grievance review process if you have: 
      • completed the State Health Plan’s first and second level grievance review and received a written second level 
        determination from the State Health Plan or its representative 
      • filed a second level grievance and have not requested or agreed to a delay in the second level grievance process, 
        but have not received the State Health Plan’s or its representative’s written decision within 60 days from the date 
        that you can demonstrate that an appeal was filed with BCBSNC, or received written notification that the State 
        Health Plan or its representative has agreed to waive the requirement to exhaust the internal appeal and/or second 
        level grievance process. 
        Expedited External Review 
      An expedited external review may be available if the time required to complete either an expedited internal 
      first or second level grievance review or standard external review would reasonably be expected to seriously 
      jeopardize your life or health or to jeopardize your ability to regain maximum function. If you meet this 
      requirement, you may make a written or verbal request to the NCDOI for an expedited external review, after 
      you receive: 
      • A non-certification from the State Health Plan or its representative and have filed a request with the State Health 
         Plan or its representative for an expedited first level appeal; or 
      • A first level appeal decision upholding a non-certification and have filed a request with the State Health Plan or 
        its representative for an expedited second level grievance review; or 
      • A second level grievance review decision from the State Health Plan or its representative. 
      In addition, prior to your discharge from an inpatient facility, you may also request an expedited external 
      review after receiving a first level appeal or second level grievance decision concerning a non-certification 
      of the admission, availability of care, continued stay or emergency health care services. 
      If your request is not accepted for expedited review, the NCDOI may: (1) accept the case for standard 
      external review if you have exhausted the internal grievance review process; or (2) require the completion 
      of the internal grievance review process and another request for an external review.  
      An expedited external review is not available for retrospective non-certifications. 
      When processing your request for external review, the NCDOI will require you to provide the NCDOI with 
      a written, signed authorization for the release of any of your medical records that need to be reviewed for 
      the purpose of reaching a decision on the external review. For further information about external review or 
      to request an external review, contact the NCDOI at:

         The Health Insurance Smart NC Program provides consumer counseling on utilization review and grievance 
         issues. Within ten business days (or, for an expedited review, within two business days after the receipt of 
         your request for an external review, the NCDOI will notify you and your provider of whether your request 
         is complete and whether it has been accepted. If the NCDOI notifies you that your request is incomplete, 
         you must provide all requested, additional information to the NCDOI within 150 days of the written notice 
         from the State Health Plan or its representative, upholding a non-certification (generally the notice of a 
         second level grievance review decision), which initiated your request for an external review. If the NCDOI 
         accepts your request, the acceptance notice will include: (i) name and contact information for the IRO 
         assigned to your case; (ii) a copy of the information about your case that the State Health Plan or its 
         representative has provided to the NCDOI; and (iii) a notification that you may submit additional written 
         information and supporting documentation relevant to the initial non-certification to the assigned IRO 
         within seven days after the receipt of the notice. It is presumed that you have received written notice two 
         days after the notice was mailed. Within seven days of the State Health Plan’s receipt of the acceptance 
         notice (or, for an expedited review, within the same day), the State Health Plan or its representative shall 
         provide the IRO and you, by the same or similar expeditious means of communication, the documents and 
         any information considered in making the non-certification appeal decision or the second level grievance 
         review decision. If you choose to provide any additional information to the IRO, you must also provide that 
         same information to the State Health Plan at the same time and by the same means of communication (e.g., 
         you must fax the information to BCBSNC if you faxed it to the IRO).

         Please note that you may also provide this additional information to the NCDOI within the seven-day 
         deadline rather than sending it directly to the IRO and the State Health Plan. The NCDOI will forward this 
         information to the IRO and the State Health Plan within two days after receiving the additional information. 
         The IRO will send you a written notice of its decision within 45 days (or, for an expedited review, within 
         three business days after the date NCDOI received your external review request. If the IRO’s decision is to 
         reverse the non-certification, the State Health Plan will, within three business days (or, for an expedited 
         review, within the same after receiving notice of the IRO’s decision, reverse the non-certification decision 
         and provide coverage for the requested service or supply. If you are no longer covered by the State Health 
         Plan at the time the State Health Plan receives notice of the IRO’s decision to reverse the non-certification, 
         the State Health Plan will only provide coverage for those services or supplies you actually received or 
         would have received prior to disenrollment if the service had not been noncertified when first requested.  
         The IRO’s external review decision is binding on the State Health Plan and you, except to the extent you 
         may have other remedies available under applicable federal or state law. You may not file a subsequent

      ADDITIONAL TERMS OF YOUR COVERAGE 
      Benefits to Which Members are Entitled 
      The benefits described in this benefit booklet are provided only for members. These benefits and the right to 
      receive payment under this health benefit plan and the right to enforce any claim arising under this health 
      benefit plan cannot be transferred or assigned to any other person or entity, including providers. Under the 
      health benefit plan, the State Health Plan’s Third Party Administrator, BCBSNC may pay a provider directly. 
      For example, BCBSNC pays in-network providers directly under applicable contracts with those providers. 
      However, any provider’s right to be paid directly is through such contract with BCBSNC, and not through the 
      Plan. Under the Plan, BCBSNC has the right to determine whether payment for services is made to the 
      provider, to the subscriber, or allocated among both. BCBSNC’s decision to pay a provider directly in no way 
      reflects or creates any rights of the provider under the Plan, including but not limited to benefits, payments or 
      procedures. 
      If a member resides with a custodial parent or legal guardian who is not the subscriber, the State Health Plan or 
      its representative will, at its option, make payment to either the provider of the services or to the custodial 
      parent or legal guardian for services provided to the member. If the State Health Plan or its representative 
      chooses to make the payment to the subscriber or custodial parent or legal guardian, it is his or her 
      responsibility to pay the provider.  
      Benefits for covered services specified in your health benefit plan will be provided only for services and 
      supplies that are performed by a provider as specified in your health benefit plan and regularly included in the 
      allowed amount. The State Health Plan or its representative establishes coverage determination guidelines that 
      specify how services and supplies must be billed in order for payment to be made under your health benefit 
      plan.  
      Any amounts paid by the State Health Plan for services not covered or that are in excess of the benefit provided 
      under your health benefit plan coverage may be recovered by the State Health Plan. The State Health Plan or 
      its representative may recover the amounts by deducting from a member's future claims payments or by 
      collecting directly from the member. This can result in a reduction or elimination of future claims payments. In 
      addition, under certain circumstances, if the State Health Plan pays the provider amounts that are your 
      responsibility, such as deductible, coinsurance, the State Health Plan may collect such amounts directly from 
      you.  
      Amounts paid by the State Health Plan for work related accidents, injuries, or illnesses covered under state 
      workers' compensation laws will be recovered upon final adjudication of the claim or an order of the applicable 
      state agency approving a settlement agreement. It is the legal obligation of the member, the employer or the 
      workers' compensation insurer (whoever is responsible for payment of the medical expenses) to notify the State 
      Health Plan or its representative in writing that there has been a final adjudication or settlement. 
      Providers are independent contractors, and they are solely responsible for injuries and damages to members 
      resulting from misconduct or negligence. 
      Disclosure of Protected Health Information (PHI) 
      The State Health Plan and its representatives, takes your privacy seriously and handles all PHI as required by 
      state and federal laws and regulations. The State Health Plan has developed a privacy notice that explains the 
      procedures. The State Health Plan privacy notice is included in the back of this booklet or it can be found on 
      the website at www.shpnc.org.

                                 Additional Terms of Your Coverage
      Administrative Discretion 
      The State Health Plan and its representatives have the authority to make reasonable determinations in the 
      administration of coverage. These determinations will be final. Such determinations include decisions 
      concerning coverage of services, care, treatment or supplies, and reasonableness of charges. Medical policies 
      are guides considered when making coverage determinations. 
      Services Received Outside Of North Carolina 
      BCBSNC has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees, generally referred to 
      as “Inter-Plan Programs.” As a member of the Plan, you have access to providers outside the state of North 
      Carolina. Your ID Card tells providers that you are a member of the Plan. While the Plan maintains its 
      contractual obligation to provide benefits to members for covered services, the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield 
      licensee in the state where you receive services (“Host Blue”) is responsible for contracting with and generally 
      handling all interactions with its participating providers. 
      Whenever you obtain health care services outside the area in which the BCBSNC network operates, the claims 
      for these services may be processed through one of these Inter-Plan Programs, which include the BlueCard 
      Program and may include Negotiated National Account Arrangements available between BCBSNC and other 
      Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees. 
      All claim types are eligible to be processed through Inter-Plan Arrangements, as described above, except for all dental 
      services (unless provided under your medical benefits), prescription medication or vision care benefits that may be 
      administered by a third party contracted by BCBSNC to provide the specific service or services.  
      Under the BlueCard Program, the amount you pay toward such covered services, such as deductibles, or 
      coinsurance, is usually based on the lesser of: 
        •  The billed charges for your covered services 
        •  The negotiated price that the “Host Blue” passes on to BCBSNC. 
      This “negotiated price” can be:   
        •  A simple discount that reflects the actual price paid by the Host Blue to your provider 
        •  An estimated price that factors in special arrangements with your provider or with a group of providers 
           that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges 
        •  An average price, based on a discount that reflects the expected average savings for similar types of 
           health care providers after taking into account the same types of special arrangements as with an 
           estimated price 
      The estimated or average price may be adjusted in the future to correct for over- or underestimation of past 
      prices. However, such adjustments will not affect the price that BCBSNC uses for your claim because they will 
      not be applied retroactively to claims already paid. 
      Federal law or the laws in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to your 
      calculation. If Federal law or any state laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a 
      surcharge, we would then calculate your liability for any covered health care services according to 
      applicable law. 
      As an alternative to the BlueCard Program and depending on your geographic location, your claim may be processed 
      through a Negotiated National Account Arrangement with a Host Blue. In these situations, the amount you pay for 
      covered services will be calculated based on the negotiated price made available to BCBSNC by the Host Blue. 
      If reference-based benefits, which are service-specific benefit dollar limits for specific procedures, based on a Host Blue’s 
      local market rates, are made available to you, you will be responsible for the amount that the healthcare provider bills 
      above the specific reference benefit limit for the given procedure. For a participating provider, that amount will be the 
      difference between the negotiated price and the reference benefit limit. For a nonparticipating provider, that amount will 
                                            63                        Return to Table of Contents  
                                      Additional Terms of Your Coverage
       be the difference between the providers’s billed charge and the reference benefit limit. Where a reference benefit limit is 
       greater than either a negotiated price or a provider’s billed charge, you will incur no liability, other than any related 
       patient cost sharing under this Plan. 
       If you receive covered services from a nonparticipating provider outside the state of North Carolina, the amount you pay 
       will generally be based on either the Host Blue’s nonparticipating provider local payment or the pricing arrangements 
       required by applicable state law. However, in certain situations, the Plan may use other payment bases, such as billed 
       charges, to determine the amount the Plan will pay for covered services from a nonparticipating provider. In any of these 
       situations, you may be liable for the difference between the nonparticipating provider’s billed amount and any payment 
       the Plan would make for the covered services.

            Value-Based Programs: BlueCard  Program 
          If you receive Covered Services under a Value-Based Program inside a Host Blue’s service area, you will not be 
          responsible for paying any of the Provider Incentives, risk-sharing, and/or Care Coordinator Fees that are a part of 
          such an arrangement, except when a Host Blue passes these fees to BCBSNC through average pricing or fee schedule 
          adjustments.  
            Value Based Programs: Negotiated (non-BlueCard Program) Arrangements 
          If BCBSNC has entered into a Negotiated National Account Arrangement with a Host Blue to provide Value-Based 
          Programs to your Employer on your behalf, BCBSNC will follow the same procedures for Value-Based Programs 
          administration and Care Coordinator Fees as noted above for the BlueCard Program.

            Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core  Program: 
          If you are outside the United States (hereinafter “BlueCard service area”), you may be able to take 
          advantage of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core® Program when accessing Covered Services. The 
          Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program is unlike the BlueCard Program available in the BlueCard 
          service area in certain ways. For instance, although the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Program assists 
          you with accessing a network of inpatient, outpatient and professional providers, the network is not served 
          by a Host Blue. As such, when you receive care from providers outside the BlueCard service area, you will 
          typically have to pay the providers and submit the claims yourself to obtain reimbursement for these 
          services. 
          If you need medical assistance services (including locating a doctor or hospital) outside the BlueCard service area, 
          you should call the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Center at 1-800-810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at 
          1-804-673-1177, 24 hours a day, and seven days a week. An assistance coordinator, working with a medical 
          professional, can arrange a physician appointment or hospitalization, if necessary. 
             Inpatient Services  
             In most cases, if you contact the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Center for assistance, hospitals will 
             not require you to pay for covered inpatient services, except for any applicable copay, deductible or coinsurance 
             amounts. In such cases, the hospital will submit your claims to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service 
             Center to begin claims processing. However, if you paid in full at the time of service, you must submit a claim to 
             receive reimbursement for covered services. You must contact BCBSNC to obtain precertification for non-
             emergency inpatient services. 
             Outpatient Services  
             Physicians, urgent care centers and other outpatient providers located outside the BlueCard service area will 
             typically require you to pay in full at the time of service. You must submit a claim to obtain reimbursement for 
             covered services.  
             Submitting a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Claim  
             When you pay for Covered Services outside the BlueCard service area, you must submit a claim to obtain 
             reimbursement. For institutional and professional claims, you should complete a Blue Cross Blue Shield Global 
             Core International claim form and send the claim form with the provider’s itemized bill(s) to the Blue Cross Blue 
             Shield Global Core Service Center (the address is on the form) to initiate claims processing. Following the 
                                                   64                            Return to Table of Contents

           instructions on the claim form will help ensure timely processing of your claim. The claim form is available from 
           BCBSNC, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service Center or online at www.bcbsglobalcore.com. If you 
           need assistance with your claim submission, you should call the Blue Cross Blue Shield Global Core Service 
           Center at 1-800-810-BLUE (2583) or call collect at 1-804-673-1177, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
      North Carolina Provider Reimbursement 
      BCBSNC has contracts with certain providers of health care services for the provision of, and payment for, 
      health care services provided to all members entitled to health care benefits. BCBSNC’s payment to providers 
      may be based on an amount other than the billed charges, including without limitation, an amount per 
      confinement or episode of care, agreed upon schedule of fees, or other methodology as agreed upon by 
      BCBSNC and the provider. Under certain circumstances, a contracting provider may receive payments from 
      BCBSNC greater than the charges for services provided to an eligible member, or BCBSNC may pay less than 
      charges for services, due to negotiated contracts. The member is not entitled to receive any portion of the 
      payments made under the terms of contracts with providers. The member’s liability when defined as a percent 
      of charge shall be calculated based on the lesser of the allowed amount or the provider’s billed charge for 
      covered services provided to a member.  
      Some out-of-network providers have other agreements with BCBSNC that affect their reimbursement for 
      covered services provided to Plan members. These providers agree not to bill members for any charges higher 
      than their agreed upon, contracted amount. In these situations, members will be responsible for the difference 
      between the Plan’s allowed amount and the contracted amount. Out-of-network providers may bill you directly. 
      If you are billed, you will be responsible for paying the bill and filing a claim with BCBSNC. 
      Right of Recovery/Subrogation Provision 
      Immediately upon paying or providing any benefit under your health benefit plan, the State Health Plan shall be 
      subrogated to all rights of recovery a member has against any party potentially responsible for making any 
      payment to a member due to a member's injuries, illness or condition to the full extent of benefits provided or to 
      be provided by your health benefit plan. 
      In addition, if a member receives any payment from any potentially responsible party as a result of an injury, 
      illness, or condition the State Health Plan has the right to recover from, and be reimbursed by, the member for 
      all amounts the State Health Plan has paid and will pay as a result of that injury or illness, up to and including 
      the full amount the member receives from all potentially responsible parties.  
      Further, the State Health Plan will automatically have a lien, to the extent of benefits advanced, upon any 
      recovery whether by settlement, judgment or otherwise, that a member receives from a third party, the third 
      party's insurer or any other source as a result of the member's injuries. The lien is in the amount of benefits paid 
      by the State Health Plan for the treatment of the illness, injury or condition for which another party is 
      responsible. 
      As used throughout this provision, the term responsible party means any party possibly responsible for making 
      any payment to a member due to a member's injuries or illness or any insurance coverage. 
      The member acknowledges that the State Health Plan's recovery rights are a first priority claim against all 
      potentially responsible parties and are to be paid to the State Health Plan before any other claim for the 
      member’s damages. The State Health Plan shall be entitled to full reimbursement first from any potential 
      responsible party payments, even if such payment to the State Health Plan will result in a recovery to the 
      member which is insufficient to make the member whole or to compensate the member in part or in whole for 
      the damages sustained. It is further understood that the State Health Plan will pay all fees associated with 
      counsel it hires to represent its interests related to any recovery it may be entitled to, but it is agreed that the 
                                            65                        Return to Table of Contents  
                         Additional Terms of Your Coverage
    State Health Plan is not required to participate in or pay court costs or attorney fees to any attorney hired by the 
    member.  
    The terms of this entire right of recovery provision shall apply and the State Health Plan is entitled to full 
    recovery regardless of whether any liability for payment is admitted by any potentially responsible party and 
    regardless of whether the settlement or judgment received by the member identifies the medical benefits the 
    State Health Plan provided. The State Health Plan is entitled to recover from any and all settlements or 
    judgments, even those designated as pain and suffering or non-economic damages only. 
    The member acknowledges that the State Health Plan delegates authority to assert and pursue the right of 
    subrogation and/or reimbursement on behalf of the State Health Plan. The member shall fully cooperate with 
    the State Health Plan or its representative's efforts to recover benefits paid by the State Health Plan. It is the 
    duty of the member to notify the State Health Plan or its representative in writing of the member's intent to 
    pursue a claim against any potentially responsible party, within 30 days of the date when any notice is given to 
    any party, including an attorney, of the intention to pursue or investigate a claim to recover damages or obtain 
    compensation due to injuries or illness sustained by the member. The member shall provide all information 
    requested by the State Health Plan or its representative including, but not limited to, completing and submitting 
    any applications or other forms or statements as the State Health Plan may reasonably request. 
    The member shall do nothing to prejudice the State Health Plan's recovery rights as herein set forth. This 
    includes, but is not limited to, refraining from entering into any settlement or recovery that attempts to reduce, 
    waive, bar or exclude the full cost of all benefits provided by your health benefit plan. 
    In the event that any claim is made that any part of this right of recovery provision is ambiguous or questions 
    arise concerning the meaning or intent of any of its terms, the member and the State Health Plan or its 
    representative agree that the State Health Plan shall have the sole authority and discretion to resolve all disputes 
    regarding the interpretation of this provision.  
    The member agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this provision may be brought in any 
    court of competent jurisdiction as the State Health Plan may elect. Upon receiving benefits under your health 
    benefit plan, the member hereby submits to each such jurisdiction, waiving whatever rights may correspond to 
    the member by reason of the member's present or future domicile. 
    If any information in this booklet conflicts with North Carolina state law or it conflicts with medical policies 
    adopted under your health benefit plan, North Carolina law and such medical policies will prevail. 
    Notice of Claim 
    Your health benefit plan will not be liable for payment of benefits unless proper notice is furnished to the State 
    Health Plan or its representative that covered services have been provided to a member. If the member files the 
    claim, written notice must be given to the State Health Plan or its designated representative within 18 months 
    after the member incurs the covered service.. The notice must be on an approved claim form and include the 
    data necessary for the State Health Plan or its representative as specifically set out in this benefits booklet to 
    determine benefits. 
    Limitations of Actions 
    No legal action may be brought to recover benefits until you have exhausted all administrative remedies, which 
    requires completion of the two-level appeals process. No legal action may be taken later than three years from 
    the date services are incurred. Please see "What If You Disagree With a Decision?" for details regarding the 
    grievance review process.

      Coordination of Benefits (Overlapping Coverage) 
      If a member is also enrolled in another group health plan, the State Health Plan may coordinate benefits with 
      the other plan. Coordination of benefits (COB) means that if a member is covered by more than one health 
      benefit plan, benefits under one plan are determined before the benefits are determined under the second plan. 
      The plan that determines benefits first is called the primary plan. The other plan is called the secondary plan. 
      Benefits paid by the secondary plan may be reduced to avoid paying benefits between the two plans that are 
      greater than the cost of the health care service.  
      The rules by which a plan is determined primary or secondary are listed below.  
           Order of Benefits Determination 
         Subscriber or Spouse: 
         • The health benefit plan covering a person as a subscriber is primary 
         • The health benefit plan covering a person as a spouse is secondary 
           Dependent Children: 
         • The health benefit plan that covers the child as a dependent of the parent whose birthday falls first 
           during the year is primary 
         • The health benefit plan that covers the child as a dependent of the parent whose birthday falls later in the 
           year is secondary 
         • If both parents have the same birthday, benefits under the Plan that has covered the parent for a longer 
           period of time shall be determined primary to the Plan that has covered the other parent for a shorter 
           period of time 
         • If the parents are divorced or separated, the following order of benefits determination is followed: 
           • Benefits under the health benefit plan that covers the child as a dependent of the parent with custody 
             are determined primary  
           • Benefits under the health benefit plan that covers the child as a dependent of the spouse of the parent 
             with custody are determined primary 
           • Benefits under the health benefit plan that covers the child as a dependent of the parent without 
             custody are secondary. 
           NOTE: If there is a court order that requires a parent to assume financial responsibility for the child's 
           health care coverage, and the State Health Plan or its representative has actual knowledge of those terms 
           of the court order, benefits under that parent's health benefit plan are determined primary. 
           Other Rules 
         • For proper coordination of your benefits, you are required to notify the State Health Plan of Medicare eligibility 
           immediately.  
         • The benefits of a plan that covers the person as an active employee (neither laid off nor retired) or as a dependent 
           of an active employee are determined before those of a plan that covers that person as a laid-off or retired 
           employee or as that employee’s dependent. If the other plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the plans do 
           not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. 
         • The health benefit plan that has covered the person the longest will be primary if none of the rules listed above 
           determine order of benefits payment 
         • If the other health benefit plan does not have rules that establish the same order of benefits as under this health 
           benefit plan, the benefits under the other plan will be determined primary to the benefits under this health benefit 
           plan. 
      Benefit Coordination 
           Active Members and Retirees Under Age 65 
         Please note that payment by the State Health Plan under your health benefit plan takes into account whether 
         the provider is a participating provider. If the State Health Plan is the secondary plan, and you use a 
                                             67                        Return to Table of Contents  
                                     Additional Terms of Your Coverage
         participating provider, your health benefit plan will coordinate up to the allowed amount. The participating 
         provider has agreed to accept the allowed amount as payment in full. If your provider is a non-participating 
         provider then the State Health Plan will coordinate up to the allowed amount but you will be responsible for 
         the difference between the allowed amount determined by the State Health Plan and what the provider 
         actually charges.  
         If a member has more than one plan for health benefit coverage, the State Health Plan or its representative 
         may request information about the other plan from the member. A prompt reply will help the State Health 
         Plan or its representative process payments quickly. There will be no payment until primary coverage is 
         determined. It is important to remember that even when benefits are coordinated with other group health 
         plans, including Medicare, benefits for services covered under your health benefit plan are still subject to 
         program requirements, such as certification procedures. 
                                                                   th
         The State Health Plan mails a Medicare eligibility letter prior to your 65  birthday, which asks that you 
         confirm your eligibility for Medicare benefits. If you are actively employed, your Health Benefits 
         Representative (HBR) will receive and forward to you the Medicare eligibility election form. 
          Medicare consists of two parts: 
          Part A: Pays inpatient hospital bills and skilled nursing facility bills. It is normally provided at no 
                  charge to those eligible for Medicare. 
          Part B: Pays outpatient hospital, doctor and other professional bills and requires a monthly 
                  payment from the person eligible for Medicare. 
         If you or your covered dependent are 65 and are not eligible for either part of Medicare, the State Health 
         Plan requires written documentation from the Social Security Administration (SSA) explaining the reason 
         for ineligibility. Benefits cannot be paid unless this documentation is received. An employee, retiree, or 
         dependent who becomes eligible for Medicare may remain covered under the State Health Plan. For proper 
         coordination of your benefits, you are required to notify the State Health Plan of Medicare eligibility 
         immediately. If Medicare becomes your primary health coverage, you must elect Medicare Part B to 
         maintain your same level of coverage.  
           State Health Plan Benefit Coordination with Medicare 
         •   If you are actively employed and eligible for Medicare, the State Health Plan is primary and Medicare 
             is secondary for you and your dependents. The only exception is if you are Medicare primary due to 
             End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) or are receiving Social Security Disability Income benefits. 
         •   If you are retired and eligible for Medicare, the State Health Plan becomes secondary coverage.  
         •   Medicare is also primary and the State Health Plan is secondary for the following Medicare-eligible 
             individuals: 
                  Retirees, including the last month that a retiree is still covered by the active group prior to being 
                   enrolled by the Retirement System. 
                  Dependents of retirees who also have Medicare. 
                  Disability retirees. 
                  Dependents of disability retirees who also have Medicare. 
                  Members with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) following the 30-month State Health Plan 
                   primary period. 
                  Individuals with “dual” Medicare entitlement. Dual entitlement occurs when Medicare is 
                   already paying as primary because of disability or age and the member also becomes eligible 
                   because of ESRD. In this case, the 30-month State Health Plan primary period is waived and 
                   Medicare continues paying as primary. 
                  Individuals who have Medicare because of disability and who are not actively working or those 
                   who are spouses of non-working employees who also have Medicare. 
                                                  68                           Return to Table of Contents  
                         Additional Terms of Your Coverage
            Former members and/or Medicare-eligible dependents covered under COBRA. 
            Former employees who are receiving the reduction in force (RIF) health benefit continuation 
             coverage. 
      All covered charges not paid by Medicare are subject to the terms and conditions of your health benefit 
      plan, including the benefit period deductible, coinsurance, and dcertification requirements. When the State 
      Health Plan is secondary, the State Health Plan will pay up to the amount that would have been paid had 
      the State Health Plan been primary. 
                  Important Information for Members Eligible for Medicare 
         You must enroll in Medicare Part B in order to receive full benefit coverage when Medicare is 
         primary. If you are covered under the State Health Plan as a member or a dependent of a member, 
         and you are eligible for Medicare Part B, your benefits under the State Health Plan will be paid 
         as if you are enrolled for coverage under Medicare Part B, regardless of whether you have 
         actually enrolled for such coverage. In other words, even if you have not enrolled in Medicare 
         Part B coverage, your health benefit plan will reduce your claim by the benefit that would have 
         been available to you under Medicare Part B, and then pay the remaining claim amount under the 
         terms of your health benefit plan. As a result, you are responsible for the amount that would 
         have been paid by Medicare Part B if you do not enroll in Medicare Part B. 
        Medicare as a Secondary Payer 
      The federal Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) rules require that, for persons covered under both Medicare 
      and a group health plan, Medicare must be the secondary payer in certain situations. This means that the 
      group health plan must not take Medicare entitlement into account in determining whether these individuals 
      are eligible to participate in the Plan, or in providing benefits under the Plan. If you or your covered 
      Dependent is eligible for Medicare, the following MSP rules apply: 
      If your Employer has 20 or more Employees, either Medicare or the Plan can be chosen as the primary 
      coverage for you, if you are an Employee who is eligible for Medicare because you are age 65 or older; and 
      your covered spouse is age 65 or older, regardless of your age. 
      If Medicare is elected as primary coverage, the law does not permit the Company’s medical plan to 
      provide benefits supplementing Medicare. Therefore, if you or your Dependent wishes to elect Medicare 
      as your primary coverage, you must terminate participation in the Company’s medical plan and have 
      Medicare as your only coverage. You should contact the Company if you wish to terminate your 
      participation in the Plan and have Medicare provide your medical benefits. Otherwise, participation in the 
      Company’s medical plan will continue to provide your primary medical benefits, with Medicare providing 
      supplemental coverage. 
      If your Employer has 100 or more Employees, medical benefits under the Plan will be paid before 
      Medicare benefits for you and your covered Dependent who is under age 65; is eligible for Medicare 
      because of disability; and is covered under the Plan because of your current employment status. 
      For all Employers, medical benefits under the Plan will be paid before Medicare benefits for you or any 
      covered Dependent qualifying for Medicare due to end-stage renal disease. The Plan will remain the 
      primary payer only during the first thirty (30) months after the earlier of: (1) the date renal dialysis 
      treatments are begun; or (2) the date of Medicare entitlement following a kidney transplant. 
      If this Plan is the primary payer under the above rules, it will provide the same medical benefits that it 
      provides for other Plan Participants who are not entitled to Medicare benefits.  
      If Medicare is the primary payer for you or any of your covered Dependents, medical benefits will be paid 
      in accordance with the Coordination of Benefits provisions of the Plan.

                         Additional Terms of Your Coverage
      Note: To protect your financial liability it is in your best interest to enroll in Medicare Part B as soon as you 
      become eligible. 
       
        MEDICAID 
      If you or any of your covered Dependents qualify for coverage under Medicaid:  
        •  Your medical benefits under this Plan will be paid before any Medicaid benefits are paid; 
        •  Eligibility and benefits under this Plan are not affected by Medicaid eligibility; and 
        •  Benefits for a Plan Participant who is also covered by Medicaid are subject to the state’s rights to subrogation 
          and reimbursement, if Medicaid benefits have been paid first for covered medical charges.

     Please review the information in this section for a general understanding of eligibility and enrollment 
     guidelines. Eligibility for the North Carolina State Health Plan is defined in Article 3B in Chapter 135 of the 
     North Carolina General Statutes. If this summary of eligibility conflicts with the General Statutes, the General 
     Statutes prevail. 
     Eligibility 
     The following individuals are eligible for coverage under the State Health Plan:  
          • All permanent full-time teachers and state employees who are either (1) paid from general or special

          • Employees of state agencies, departments, institutions, boards and commissions, not otherwise 
            covered by the State Health Plan, who are employed in permanent job positions on a recurring basis

          • Employees on approved leave of absence with pay, or receiving workers' compensation. If you are 
            receiving workers compensation, but separated from service (i.e. no longer an employee, then you 
            are no longer eligible for State Health Plan benefits). 
          • Employees on approved leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA). 
          •  Former employees who are receiving disability retirement benefits are eligible for the benefit

           people will cease, however, as of the end of the month in which the former employee is no longer 
           eligible for disability retirement benefits. 
          •  Retirees employed by an employing unit that elects to provide this coverage and the retiree does 
           not qualify for coverage as a permanent employee and are determined to be “full-time” by their 
           employing unit in accordance with section 4980H of the Internal Revenue Code.

        • Retired former employees with 10, but less than 20 years of retirement service who were first hired 
          on or after October 1, 2006. 
    In addition, by paying the full cost of coverage, the following individuals may enroll in the State Health Plan:

        • Surviving spouses of deceased retirees and surviving spouses of deceased teachers, State employees, 
          and members of the General Assembly if the spouse was covered at the time of death and the death 
          occurred after September 30, 1986. 
        • Certain surviving dependent children who are covered by the State Health Plan at the time of the 
          employee’s death are entitled to coverage as a surviving dependent or who were covered under the 
          State Health Plan on September 30, 1986. In the absence of an eligible surviving parent, each child 
          is eligible for member only (individual) coverage until attaining one of the usual dependent children 
          ineligibility events. If a surviving child was certified and covered as an incapacitated dependent, the 
          dependent is eligible for life, or until the dependent ceases to be incapacitated. When coverage 
          ceases for a surviving dependent child, they may be eligible for continuation coverage. 
        • The spouses and eligible dependent children of former employees whose jobs were eliminated 
          because of reduction in funds. 
        • An employee on official leave of absence without pay.

    Dependent Eligibility 
    For dependents to be covered under the State Health Plan’s 80/20 Plan, the employee or retiree must be covered 
    and their dependent must be one of the following: 
        • Spouse 
                                  72                 Return to Table of Contents  
                            When Coverage Begins and Ends 
        • A natural, legally adopted or foster child of the subscriber and/or spouse up to the end of the month 
          of their 26th birthday. Dependent child includes a child for whom the subscriber is a court-appointed 
          guardian, and a stepchild of the subscriber who is married to the stepchild’s natural parent.  
    Dependent child coverage may be extended beyond the 26th birthday under the following condition:  
        • The dependent is physically or mentally incapacitated to the extent that they are incapable of earning 
          a living and such handicap developed or began to develop before the dependent's 26th birthday if the 
          dependent was covered by the State Health Plan. When requesting extension of coverage, or for 
          further information, employees should contact the Plan’s Eligibility and Enrollment Support Center 
          at the number listed in “Who to Contact.” 
    The State Health Plan requires documentation to verify a dependent’s eligibility to be covered as a dependent.  
    No person shall be eligible for coverage as an employee or retired employee or as a dependent of an employee or 
    retired employee upon a finding by the Executive Administrator, Treasurer, or Board of Trustees or by a court 
    of competent jurisdiction that the employee or dependent knowingly and willfully made or caused to be made a 
    false statement or false representation of a material fact in a claim for reimbursement. 
    Enrolling in the Plan 
    It is very important that you apply for coverage and/or add dependents when you or your dependents are first 
    eligible to enroll on the State Health Plan.  
    New employees who do not elect to enroll themselves or their dependents on the State Health Plan within 30 
    days of hire (first eligible) will not be allowed to enroll unless they experience a qualifying life event or enroll 
    during Open Enrollment.  
        Dual Enrollment 
      No person shall be eligible for coverage as an employee or retired employee and as a dependent of an 
      employee or retired employee at the same time, except when a spouse is eligible on a fully contributory 
      basis. In addition, no person shall be eligible for coverage as a dependent of more than one employee or 
      retired employee at the same time. 
        Qualifying Life Events that Allow Coverage Changes 
      If you have one of the following qualifying life events during the year, you will be able to make a coverage change 
      that is on account of and corresponds with the qualifying life event. You are required to provide supporting 
      documentation. Documentation can be uploaded in the Document Center of eEnroll, the Plan’s enrollment system, or 
      provided to your Health Benefits Representative to verify the qualifying life event in accordance to the State Health 
      Plan policy.  
        •  Your marital status changes due to marriage, death of a spouse, divorce, legal separation, or annulment 
        •  You obtain a dependent through marriage, birth, adoption, placement in anticipation of adoption, or foster care 
          placement of an eligible child 
        •  You or your dependents experience an employment status change that results in the loss or gain of coverage 
          under another group health benefit plan. 
        •  You or your dependents become Medicare eligible 
        •  Your dependent ceases to be an eligible dependent (dependent child turns 26). 
        •  You, your spouse, or your dependents commence or return from an unpaid leave of  absence 
          such as Family and Medical Leave or military leave. 
        •  You receive a qualified medical child support order (as determined by the  Plan administrator) that 
          requires the Plan to provide coverage for your children. 
        •  If you, your spouse or dependents experience a cost or coverage change under another group 
          health plan for which an election change was permitted, you may make a corresponding election 
          change under the Flex Plan (e.g. your spouse’s employee significantly increases the cost of 
          coverage and as a result, allows the spouse to change his/her election) 
                                  73                 Return to Table of Contents  
                                    When Coverage Begins and Ends 
           •  If you change employment status such that you are no longer expected to average 30 hours  of 
             service per week but you do not lose eligibility for coverage under the  State Health Plan (e.g. you 
             are in a stability period during which you qualify as full -time), you may still prospectively revoke 
             your election provided that you certify that you have or will enroll yourself (and any other 
             covered family members) in other coverage providing minimum essential coverage (e.g. the 
             Marketplace) that is effective no later than the first day of the second month following the month 
             that includes the date the original coverage is revoked 
           •  You may prospectively revoke your State Health Plan election if you certify your intent to enroll 
             yourself and any covered dependents in the Marketplace for coverage that is effective beginning 
             no later than the day immediately following the last day of the original coverage that is revoked 
           • You or your dependents lose coverage due to loss of eligibility under Medicaid or the Children’s 
             Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and apply for coverage under this Plan within 60 days 
           • You or your dependents become eligible for premium assistance with respect to coverage under this 
             Plan under Medicaid or CHIP and apply for coverage under this Plan within 60 days.  
           • If you, your spouse or your dependent loses eligibility for coverage (as defined by HIPAA) under 
             any group health plan or health insurance coverage (e.g., coverage in the individual market, 
             including the marketplace), you may change your participation election. 
        In addition, eligible surviving spouses and any eligible surviving dependent child of a deceased retiree, 
        teacher, State employee, member of the General Assembly, former member of the General Assembly, or 
        Disability Income Plan beneficiary may continue coverage as long as they were enrolled at the time of the 
        member’s death and elect to continue coverage within 90 days after the death of the former State Health 
        Plan member. 
        The coverage change request must occur within 30 days of the qualifying life event (except as specifically 
        described above) or you will have to wait until the next Open Enrollment period. Retirees and surviving spouses 
        are not required to experience a qualifying event if they wish to disenroll themselves or their dependents 
        from the Plan; they may disenroll at any time.  
        Please note: Losing individual coverage doesn’t qualify as a qualifying life event if you voluntarily drop 
        coverage, if you lose coverage because you didn’t pay your premiums, or if you lose coverage because you 
        didn’t provide required documentation when asked for more information. 
      Enrollment Exceptions 
      To make an enrollment exception request, active members must contact their HBR and request that the HBR 
      file an enrollment exception request with the State Health Plan. Non-Active Members (Retirees, Disabled 
      Members, RIF Members, COBRA Members, former Members of the General Assembly and other 100% 
      contributory Members) must contact the State Health Plan office at 919-814-4400 to file an enrollment 
      exception request. Enrollment exception requests must be submitted to State Health Plan within the 
      following timeframe: Within sixty (60) days of enrollment, termination or change in benefit election or 
      within thirty (30) days of premium deduction or premium payment due date reflecting enrollment, 
      termination, or change in benefit election, whichever is later. 
      Adding or Removing a Dependent 
      If you want to add or remove a dependent due to a qualifying life event, you will need to do so through 
      eEnroll, the Plan’s enrollment system. To access eEnroll, visit the www.shpnc.org and click “Enroll 
      Now/Access Benefits.” Failure to remove a dependent timely could result in loss of eligibility for 
      continuation of coverage. 
      To add a dependent, the coverage change must occur within 30 days of the qualifying life event unless 
      otherwise specified or you must wait until the next Open Enrollment period. The effective date of coverage 
                                           74                       Return to Table of Contents  
                                      When Coverage Begins and Ends 
      for the dependent will be the first day of the month following the qualifying life event, except in the case of 
      a newborn child or adopted child.  
      If you are adding a newborn child, the coverage effective date must be the first day of the month in which 
      the child is born.  A newborn child must be enrolled within 30 days of their date of birth.  A subscriber 
      changing from employee-only or employee-spouse coverage will be required to pay any additional 
      premiums for employee/child(ren) or employee-family coverage retroactive to the first of the month in 
      which the child is born. 
      The effective date for an adopted child can be the date of adoption, or date of placement in the adoptive 
      parents’ home, or the first of the month following the date of adoption or placement.  An adopted child must 
      be enrolled within 30 days of the date of adoption or placement.  A subscriber changing from employee-
      only or employee-spouse coverage will be required to pay any additional premiums for employee/child(ren) 
      or employee-family coverage retroactive to the first of the month in which the date of adoption or placement 
      occurred if either is the effective date.   
      If you are an active member you may remove dependents from your coverage within 30 days of a qualifying life 
      event. Coverage for dependents will end at the last day of the month in which the qualifying life event occurred. 
      Dependents must be removed from coverage when they are no longer eligible, such as when a child is no longer 
      eligible due to age, enters active military service, or when the spouse is no longer eligible due to divorce or 
      death. 
      If you are a retired member or surviving spouse you may remove dependents from your coverage without a 
      qualifying life event. To add dependents you must experience a qualifying life event or add them during 
      Open Enrollment.  
      Qualified Medical Child Support Order 
      A Qualified Medical Child Support Order (QMCSO) is any judgment, decree or order that is issued by an 
      appropriate court or through an administrative process under state law that: (1) provides for coverage of the 
      child of a member under the State Health Plan; and (2) is either issued according to state law or a law relating to 
      medical child support described in Section 1908 of the Social Security Act. A QMCSO must be specific as to 
      the Plan, the participant whose child(ren) is (are) to be covered, the type of coverage, the child(ren) to be 
      covered and the length of coverage. 
      Effective Dates of Coverage 
      The effective date for new employees is determined based on the following: 
           •  The effective date of coverage is the first day of the month following the date of employment or the first day 
              of the second month. For example, if the date of employment is October 12, coverage may begin November 1 
              or December 1. Eligible dependents must be enrolled with the same effective date as the employee, unless 
              there is a qualifying event. 
      Types of Coverage 
      Your health benefit plan offers the following types of coverage: 
           •  Employee only coverage -The health benefit plan covers the employee or retiree 
           •  Employee spouse coverage - The health benefit plan covers the employee or the retiree and his/her 
              spouse.  
           •  Employee child(ren) coverage - The health benefit plan covers the employee and his/her dependent 
              child or children; or the retiree and his/her dependent child or children 
           •  Family coverage - The health benefit plan covers the employee, his/her spouse and his/her dependent 
              child or children; or the retiree, his/her spouse and his/her dependent child or children; 
                                             75                        Return to Table of Contents  
                                   When Coverage Begins and Ends 
     Reporting Changes 
     Have you moved, added or changed other health coverage, changed your name or phone number? If so, contact 
     your HBR or follow the online process for updating your information through your enrollment system. It will 
     help us give you better service if the State Health Plan or its representative is kept informed of these changes.  
     When Coverage Ends 
     Coverage for you or your dependents ends the last day of the month in which an ineligibility event occurs. 
     Some examples of ineligibility events are divorce, entering active military service, and termination of 
     employment. For additional ineligibility events, contact the Plan’s Eligibility and Enrollment Support Center at 
     the number in “Who to Contact.” You must make the change request through eEnroll when there is a change of 
     eligibility for a dependent. If notification is not made within the 30 days following the dependent’s ineligibility 
     event, the dependent will be removed from coverage on the last day of the month in which the notification is 
     received, and the coverage type change will be the first of the month following notification, except in the case 
     of death, in which case the coverage type change will be made retroactively to the first of the month following 
     death. 
     Premium payments are due by the first day of the effective month. The premium payment grace period ends 
     thirty (30) days after the due date. Members who do not pay their premiums in full by the end of the grace 
     period will have their coverage canceled. If the premium payment is received after the coverage is canceled for 
     nonpayment, but the postmark is on or before the end of the grace period, the coverage may be reinstated. This 
     applies to members in a category that requires the member to be responsible for paying the full premium or a 
     portion of the premium directly to the employing unit or the Plan’s billing vendor. 
     If the premium amount due is only for dependent coverage, then only the dependent coverage will be 
     terminated; however, if the premium is for both the subscriber and the dependents, all members of the family 
     will have their coverage canceled.  
     If you are terminated due to nonpayment, you will not be able to come back on the Plan until the next Open 
     Enrollment period, even if you experience a qualifying life event.  
     Coverage for you or your dependents may also end on the date through which premiums have been paid.  
     You or your dependents may be eligible for continuation coverage under COBRA or to convert to a non-
     employer sponsored plan the first day of the month following an eligibility event. 
     Coverage may end on the last day of the month in which you or your covered dependent is found to have 
     knowingly and willfully made or caused to be made a false statement or false representation of a material fact 
     regarding eligibility or enrollment information or in a claim for reimbursement under the Plan. Persons that 
     commit fraud against the State Health Plan are ineligible for coverage for minimum of five years and there is 
     no guarantee that coverage will ever be reinstated.  
     Please notify your health care providers and pharmacy if you are no longer eligible for coverage. In the 
     event claims are paid on behalf of a former member who is no longer eligible or whose coverage has terminated, 
     the Plan reserves the right to recover those amounts directly from the subscriber or former member.

     charge established by BCBSNC using a methodology that is applied to comparable providers who may have entered into 
     an agreement with BCBSNC for similar services under a similar health benefit plan. Calculation of the allowed amount is 
     based on several factors including BCBSNC's medical, payment and administrative guidelines. Under the guidelines, some

                           Notice of Grandfather Status 
     The State Health Plan believes the 70/30 Plan is a “grandfathered health plan” under the Patient Protection 
     and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act). As permitted by the Affordable Care Act, a grandfathered 
     health plan can preserve certain basic health coverage that was already in effect when that law was enacted. 
     Being a grandfathered health plan means that your plan may not include certain consumer protections of the 
     Affordable Care Act that apply to other plans, for example, the requirement for the provision of preventive 
     health services without any cost sharing. However, grandfathered health plans must comply with certain other 
     consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act, for example, the elimination of lifetime limits on benefits. 
     Questions regarding which protections apply and which protections do not apply to a grandfathered health 
     plan and what might cause a plan to change from grandfathered health plan status can be directed to Customer 
     Service at 888-234-2416. You may also contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services at 
     www.healthcare.gov. As a plan “grandfathered” under the Affordable Care Act, cost sharing for preventive 
     benefits may continue as it does currently and be based on the location where the service is provided.
